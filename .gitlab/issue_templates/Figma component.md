<!-- Start by making a copy of the component template to your own drafts.

In Figma:
1. Duplicate the component template https://www.figma.com/file/OmvFfWkqEsdGhXAND133ou/Component?node-id=0%3A1
2. Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select “Move to Project…”
   and select your Drafts as the new location.
3. Update the template with your component name and start designing ;)
-->

<!--Add a short description of the component. If it’s helpful, add a checklist of variations
and states to the description so that a reviewer can be sure to cross reference everything
that has been completed.-->

<!--Use the Figma share feature and make sure that “anyone with the link” can view. Then,
specifically invite the reviewer with “edit” permissions selected. Anyone can duplicate the
file to their own drafts and edit from there, but the reviewer can directly edit and
collaborate on the file. This will help maintain the integrity of the initial draft.-->
