<!--
Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes in the Component Library file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in this new file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from instances in the UI kit.
   - To create a new component, duplicate our component template (https://www.figma.com/file/OmvFfWkqEsdGhXAND133ou/Component-template) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and start designing.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the UX Foundations project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”
