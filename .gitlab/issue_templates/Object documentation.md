### Checklist

Make sure these tasks are completed before closing the issue. If you have any questions, reach out to a [FE/UX Foundations designer][foundations-team].

1. [ ] **Assignee**: Identify the necessary updates or additions, and define a clear scope of your contribution in the “Description” section above. For example: “This issue will document a new User object in Figma and add the User object documentation to Pajamas.” Learn more about objects in the [object overview page](https://design.gitlab.com/objects/overview).
1. [ ] **Assignee**: Change or add an object's **conceptual model**.
   1. [ ] [Create a branch in Figma](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) from the [Conceptual model file](https://www.figma.com/file/J68bePHXIN5OPWqaFFY9ri/Conceptual-model?node-id=5422%3A470), and add the issue/MR number to the new branch name. That new branch is your “working file”.
    - [ ] Follow the existing product data structure as closely as possible. The [GitLab API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/) is a good starting point to identify the existing objects, their attributes, actions and relationships. 
    - [ ] Study the UI layouts that represent the object to inform your diagram. However, keep the object model UI-agnostic. Sometimes an attribute or action in the UI is inherited from a different object. 
    - [ ] Use [the existing file components](https://www.figma.com/file/J68bePHXIN5OPWqaFFY9ri/branch/bMpqqGQtDoPqty4sAFPUsy/Conceptual-model?node-id=5423%3A453) to map out the object diagram.
    - [ ] If possible, gather feedback from Engineers, Product Manager, or Technical Writer to make sure your object diagram is accurate and understandable.
1. [ ] **Assignee**: Change or add an object's **semantic layout**. This may be required if the object's conceptual model was also changed.
   1. [ ] [Create a branch in Figma](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) from the [Semantic layouts file]((https://www.figma.com/file/shVF8UZwrQtkNfMDjcrsyH/Semantic-layouts?node-id=1%3A79), and add the issue/MR number to the new branch name. That new branch is your “working file”.
    - [ ] Map out the primary layout for the object you're adding or updating. View [Layouts](https://design.gitlab.com/objects/overview#layouts) for more information.
1. [ ] **Assignee**: Update the link to the working file(s) in the issue 
   description.
1. [ ] **Assignee**: Ask a [FE/UX Foundations designer][foundations-team]
   to review your working file(s) (ensure they have edit permissions in Figma).
1. [ ] **Reviewer**: Review and approve assignee’s working file(s). Specific 
   questions can be addressed with comments in Figma. Comment in this issue when the content is less specific to the working file(s) or requires greater visibility.
1. [ ] **Reviewer**: Assign to a [Figma maintainer][figma-maintainer]
   for final review (make sure they have edit permissions in Figma).
1. [ ] **Maintainer**: Review and approve assignee’s changes.
1. [ ] **Maintainer**: Merge the branch or add the changes or additions to the
   target file.
     1. [ ] Ensure that all styles and components now belong to the target file.
1. [ ] **Maintainer**: When applicable, [publish][publishing] any library 
   changes along with a clear commit message.
1. [ ] **Assignee** (or Maintainer, for community contributions): If it’s a new
   object or a significant change, add an agenda item to the next UX weekly call to inform the team.
1. [ ] **Assignee**: When applicable, create an MR to add or update the object’s documentation page. If you do not have the capacity, create an issue in this repository using the `Object documentation` issue template. Bring the issue to your team planning session for prioritization and scheduling. Mark the new issue as related to this one.
1. [ ] **Assignee**: 🎉 Congrats, you made it! You can now close this issue.
