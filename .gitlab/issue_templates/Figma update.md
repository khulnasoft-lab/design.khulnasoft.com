## Description

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding
a checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross reference everything that has been completed. -->

<!--
- For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the ‚Äúworking file‚Äù). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
- For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the ‚Äúworking file‚Äù) and proceed with the design.
- For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
‚ÄúMove to Project‚Ä¶‚Äù and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the ‚Äúworking file.‚Äù

## Checklist

Make sure the following are completed before closing the issue:

### Assignee tasks:

<details><summary>Getting started:</summary>

1. [ ] Title the issue using this structure "Figma > [Component name] - [Description]". For example, Figma > Badges - Fix icon override bug.
1. [ ] Add the relevant [component label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/labels?subscribed=&search=component%3A). For example ~"component:badge".
1. [ ] If you‚Äôre making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the [Pajamas UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/781156790581391771), start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, `#860-table-component-updates-lvanc`. 
1. [ ] When applicable, follow our [structure][structure], [building][building], and [annotation][annotation] guidelines. If you have any questions, reach out to a [Foundations designer][foundations-team].
1. [ ] Update the link to the working file under the **Figma link** section below.
1. [ ] If work was not done in a branch (a merged branch will automatically be archived), move your working file 
   to the shared Figma project:
     1. For Component library changes, move your file to the [**Component archive**][component-archive] project.
     1. For all other changes, move your file to the [**Misc archive**][misc-archive] project.
     1. If you‚Äôre a community contributor, please consider [transferring ownership of your draft file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040530853) to the maintainer so they can move it to our archive, along with its version history and comments.

<details><summary>Prior to review:</summary>

The purpose of these tasks is to ensure consistency with the rest of the components and to save time during the review process. When you are finished with your update, please go through the following clean-up tasks in Figma:

1. [ ] **Canvas**: Make sure no hidden elements have been accidentally left behind. Use **View > Show Outlines** (<kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd>) to reveal invisible objects. Use **View > Zoom to Fit** (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd>) to view all items on the page.
1. [ ] **Components**: Where applicable, make sure all components have updated descriptions and have external documentation links.
1. [ ] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.
1. [ ] **Layers**: Make sure all your layers are correctly named and the order match visual from left to right. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.
1. [ ] **Variants**: Remove the default dashed purple stroke, border radius, and padding from all variants.
1. [ ] **Variants**: Reorder variants in properties panel to match visual order. In the case of Auto Layout, Figma will determine layer order.
1. [ ] **Comments**: Make sure all comments and discussion are resolved.

If any of these tasks are unclear, see the [Table component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=47785%3A58915) for reference.
