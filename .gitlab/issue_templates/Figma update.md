## Description

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding
a checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross reference everything that has been completed. -->

<!--
- For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the ‚Äúworking file‚Äù). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
- For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the ‚Äúworking file‚Äù) and proceed with the design.
- For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
‚ÄúMove to Project‚Ä¶‚Äù and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the ‚Äúworking file.‚Äù

1. [ ] **Components**: Make sure all components have correct names, properties, and descriptions along with external documentation links where applicable. View the [components][components] guides for details.
1. [ ] **Frames**: Make spacing within and between frames consistent with components found on other pages.
