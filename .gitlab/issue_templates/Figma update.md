<!--
Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”
