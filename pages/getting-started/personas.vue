        <h3>Job Summary</h3>
        <p>I am responsible for defining and scoping features, incorporating company objectives into the product roadmap, and giving developers and designers the requirements they need to deliver strong features. Whether I’m making sure I have the right skill-sets on the team, prioritizing feature requests, or ensuring that we deliver on time, my job is to set my team up for success.</p>
        <h3>Motivations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When company objectives shift, I want to have a standard process for communication in place, so that I can be in sync with all team members.</li>
          <li>When development begins, I want to see an overview of all the relevant information related to a feature or project, so that I can monitor progress throughout a cycle.</li>
          <li>When I’m planning for the next cycle, I want to see a history of how accurately the developers on my team estimated their capacity, so that I can be sure that key features will be delivered on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frustrations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It can be difficult to know the status of certain requirements, when my team members do not take the time to update the various tools we use.</li>
          <li>I often have trouble balancing feature requests with capacity.</li>
          <li>It can be difficult to give clients a reasonable timeframe that is not off-base, since a cycle is often unpredictable.</li>
          <li>It’s challenging to explain why certain features have been delayed or deprioritized, when customers and upper-level management are not working closely with the team.</li>

        <h3>Job Summary</h3>
        <p>I am responsible for meeting with the product management team to discuss and schedule features, so we can convert concepts into practical solutions. I ensure that capacity is properly estimated, create program specifications, and often mentor junior developers.</p>
        <h3>Motivations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When discussing feature requests, I want to receive clear requirements from the product and design teams, so my team can deliver on time and reduce back-and-forth communication.</li>
          <li>When assessing team resources, I want to see a history of how accurately developers on my team have estimated their capacity, so that I can assign them to the right tasks.</li>
          <li>When important deadlines are approaching, I want all team members to reliably update our tools, so that I can track progress without having to search for relevant information in other communication channels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frustrations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It can be difficult for my team to do thorough code reviews in a reasonable timeframe, while still making progress on their own assignments.</li>
          <li>When demand surpasses our current capacity, it can be stressful to resolve issues while not creating new ones that result from hasty work.</li>
          <li>I am not always aware of the best way to explain technical limitations to stakeholders who are not involved in the development process.</li>

        <p>I provide support for our infrastructure, environments, and integrations. I split my time between coding to implement features and bug fixes, and helping developers deploy, build, and release as efficiently as possible. </p>

          <li>When I’m advocating for a new process or tool, I want to point to a metric or test, so I can support my case with something objective.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frustrations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is hard for me to quantify my efforts and convince others of time that will be saved in the future by investing time in proactive tasks in the present.</li>
          <li>I'm frustrated by the avoidable crises, caused by a lack of communication, that derail my work and burn up my resources.</li>
          <li>I dislike frequent context-switching and being responsible for some tasks that I feel I am not good at, because of the many hats my job requires me to wear.</li>
          <li>I'm frustrated by the politics of convincing people to adopt my recommendations.</li>
