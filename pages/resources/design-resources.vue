      <h2>Design Repository</h2>
      <p>All design files are stored in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design">gitlab-design</a> repository and maintained by GitLab UX designers. The repository contains GitLab’s open source design pattern library, prototypes, and work-in-progress files.</p>
      <h5>Goals</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Jumpstart design work by using the design pattern library and previous work</li>
        <li>Enable frequent, stable, and consistent contributions</li>
        <li>Make GitLab’s design open, transparent, and open source</li>
        <li>Facilitate design handoffs and design–development communication design handoffs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The project is primarily used by GitLab’s UX Design department to host design files and hand them off for implementation. To learn about the best practices to manage the project, including the repository’s organization, check out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>

      <h2>Brand AI</h2>
      <p>Brand.ai is a hosted team library used to sync symbols and styles across sketch files. Our UI paradigms are included within brand.ai for easy access when working on designs. Visit our public-facing <a href="https://brand.ai/git-lab/primary-brand">GitLab Brand.ai</a> styleguide.</p>
      <h2>GitLab SVGs</h2>
      <p>Our <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs">GitLab SVG</a> repository manages all SVG assets by creating an SVG sprite out of icons and optimizing SVG based illustrations.</p>
