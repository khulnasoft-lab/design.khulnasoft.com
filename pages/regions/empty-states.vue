      <h1>Empty states</h1>
      <p>Empty states should be considered during the implentation of new features. They are vital to helping onboard new users, making the experience feel more approachable and understandable.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>An empty state is our way to communicate to the user that there is no content to load and what action they should take next. They should tell users: what itâ€™s for, why they are seeing it and what they need to do next.</p>
      <p>Empty states are composed of 3 elements</p>
      <strong>1. Illustration</strong>
      <p>The illustration should compliment the need for the empty state</p>
      <strong>2. Message</strong>
      <p>The message should be concise and explain why the user is seeing this state</p>
      <strong>3. Call to action</strong>
      <p>typically taking the form of a button, the text should be direct and stuff</p>

      <h3>Size</h3>
      <p>Max size on empty state illustrations is <strong>425px wide by 375px tall</strong>. Do not scale smaller illustrations up to this size as they will look too large. Instead use the original size of the illustration if it has already been drawn.</p>
