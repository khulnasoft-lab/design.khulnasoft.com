      <h1>Buttons</h1>
      <p>Buttons execute an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience. Different button types help guide users through certain actions. Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it either by text, icon, or both. Additional meaning can be derived from the button style.</p>

      <h2>Types</h2>
      <p>Different button types bring varying emphasis to potential user actions. This makes the page comprehensive while guiding the user through performing a task.</p>

      <h3>Primary</h3>
      <p>Primary buttons represent the predominate action on the page and thus have the most emphasis placed upon them. Primary buttons are recognized by their solid color and must use one of the four elementary button styles: Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), or Danger (red).</p>

      <h3>Secondary</h3>
      <p>Secondary buttons represent supplementary actions that the user is motivated to take. The outlined styling places less emphasis on these buttons. Just like primary buttons, secondary buttons also require one of the four elementary button styles: Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), or Danger (red).</p>

      <h3>Tertiary</h3>
      <p>A tertiary button is the default button type. Tertiary buttons still have an outlined styling but cannot have one of the four elementary button styles. They are typically used for less important actions that are not promoted to the user.</p>

      <h2>States</h2>
      <p>Buttons change depending on the user's interaction or set behaviour. This is to ensure they are accessible and feel responsive in both desktop and mobile environments. Additionally disabled and read-only buttons need certain interaction restrictions and a certain styling for their meaning to become apparent to the user.</p>

      <h3>Hover, Active, and Focus</h3>
      <p>Buttons change depending on the user's interaction with them. In all three states the buttons will have a thicker border and their background color will change. For the focus state, buttons will get an additional blue glow indicating that they are in focus.</p>

      <h3>Disabled</h3>
      <p>Disabled buttons are prevented from having any true interaction with the user. They are there to let the user know a certain action would be possible if circumstances were different. All buttons regardless of style are styled the same way when in the disabled state. Additionally they will show the "not-allowed" cursor style when hovered upon and have a faded text color.</p>

      <h2>Styles</h2>
      <p>Buttons derive additional meaning from their presented style and help the user quickly presume any consequences that button may cause when clicked.</p>

      <h3>Neutral</h3>
      <p>The neutral button style is used most often and is generally picked when using tertiary buttons. It features grayscale colors with a white background.</p>

      <h3>Elementary</h3>
      <p>Our elementary button styles all convey a different meaning due to their respective styling. Their colors are aligned with our <a href="/foundations/colors">four primary chromatic colors</a>.</p>

      <h4>Info</h4>
      <p>Buttons that represent activation or informative processes. Additionally any actions that do not fit any of the other categories also fit in this category. They are represented in a blue color.</p>

      <h4>Success</h4>
      <p>Buttons that represent positive actions such as the creation or addition of items. They are represented in a green color.</p>

      <h4>Warning</h4>
      <p>Buttons that represent actions where the user should be cautious such as overriding certain rulesets. These actions can be undone or somehow rectified by the user if a mistake is made. They are represented in an orange color.</p>

      <h4>Danger</h4>
      <p>Buttons that represent actions that are destructive, such as deleting content. These actions cannot be undone. They are represented in a red color.</p>

      <h3>Dashed</h3>
      <p>Dashed button styles are used when something has not yet been created. Their action will create the missing item and will be replaced by that content.</p>

      <h3>Dark and Inverted</h3>
      <p>Some circumstances are exceptions in that they require a different button style than normal in order for those to still be accessible. When UI is darker than normal they can require either a dark or inverted  button style. These button styles are only possible for tertiary button types.</p>
