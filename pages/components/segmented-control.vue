      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <!-- <p>The date picker comes in two parts: the input field and the date picker dropdown. The input field must use a placeholder text to indicate the expected format of time to be entered (e.g. "YYYY-MM-DD") and a calendar icon on the right edge to indicate that clicking on it will open a datepicker dropdown.</p>
      <p>The user should be able to input the date by either typing it in or choosing a day from the datepicker dropdown. The user must never be forced to use only one of the two input methods.</p> -->
