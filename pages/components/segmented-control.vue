      <h1>Segmented control</h1>
      <p>A segmented control allows users to choose one out of a range of available options. It is a button group of equal options where only one can be selected and active. There must always be one option active.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>A segmented control is commonly used as an alternative to <a href="/components/dropdowns">dropdowns</a>, <a href="/components/radio-buttons">radio buttons</a>, or <a href="/components/toggles">toggles</a>, but it comes with its own limitations. Because it takes up more space, a segmented control should only be used for up to 5 options. It is ideal when there are 2 or 3 because they visually expose the options available to a user. A segmented control should be used instead of a dropdown when there are only a few options and enough room to fit within the UI. It requires fewer interactions and is easier to use on mobile devices, thus having a smaller effect on the user’s cognitive load. Results are effective and visible immediately similar to toggles.</p>
      <p>A segmented control may replace a group of radio buttons or a toggle to allow users to choose between two or multiple options. In order to help choosing the right solution follow the table below.</p>

      <h3>Labels</h3>
      <p>Label positioning rules are the same as they are for <a href="/components/forms">forms</a>. They can be placed to the left of segmented control when there’s a lack of vertical space. But by default, the label comes above the segmented control.</p>
      <p>The label can be omitted in cases when it’s clear what the segmented control is referring to from the UI (for example, switching between a day, week or month view in a calendar UI).</p>
      <p class="todo">Todo: Add live component block with code example (whitespace exmple)</p>
      <p>Button labels need to be as short as possible and should ideally be only one word. Sometimes, that can be done by removing the repeating word and using it as a label (above the segmented control). For example, instead of having button labels “Show whitespace” and “Hide whitespace” use “Whitespace” as a label and only “Show” and “Hide” as button labels.</p>
      <p>Alternatively icons can be used to replace button labels.</p>
      <h3>Sizing</h3>
      <p>The options must be equal in width and prominence. If there are 3 options, each of them should take 33% of the total width of segmented control.</p>
