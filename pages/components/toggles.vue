      <h1>Toggles</h1>
      <p>A toggle is a visual switch which acts as a boolean.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Use toggles when there is a choice between two selections, it has a default state, the results are effective and noticeable immediately, and there is <strong>no need</strong> for a user to click a submit button.</p>
      <p> Avoid using toggles when a submit button is needed. This confuses users and dilutes the experience by preventing instant results.</p>
      <p>Toggles may replace a segmented control, two radio buttons, or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposing states. For help with choosing the right solution, follow the table below.</p>

      <h3>Labels</h3>
      <p>Toggle labels are set in bold, positioned above the element by default, and should describe what the control will do when the switch is on in a concise, direct, and short way.</p>
      <p>In rare cases and exceptions, the label can be placed to the left of the input field. Examples include non inline positioned elements.</p>
      <h3>Visual Design</h3>
      <p>Toggles should use high-contrast colors to indicate the states - On and Off.</p>
