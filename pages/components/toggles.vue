      <h1>Toggles</h1>
      <p>A toggle is a digital visual switch which includes two mutually exclusive states - either On or Off - one is active by default.</p>
      <!-- Usage -->
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Use toggles when there is a choice between two selections, it has a default state, the results are effective and noticable immediately, and there is <strong>no need</strong> for a user to click a submit button.</p>
			<p>Avoid using toggles in for example <a href="/components/forms">forms</a> where a submit button is needed in order to confirm the user's input. This would confuse the user and dillute the expected experience of producing instant results for any toggle throughout the interface.</p>
			<p>Toggles may replace a segmented control, two radio buttons, or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposing states. In order to help choosing the right solution follow the table below.</p>

						<th>When does the selection take effect?</th>

			<h3>Labels</h3>
				<p>Toggle labels are set in bold, positioned above the element by default, and should describe what the control will do when the switch is on in a concise, direct, and short way.</p>
			<h3>Visual Design</h3>
			<p>Toggles should use high-contrast colors to indicate the states - On and Off.</p>
