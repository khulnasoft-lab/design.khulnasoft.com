      <h1>Labels</h1>
      <p>Labels allow users to categorize UI objects using descriptive titles and customizable color. They provide a quick way to recognize which category or categories the labeled object belongs. Clicking on a label navigates the user to a filtered list view based on that label.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Labels are used to categorize issues, merge requests, and epics. They can be used to filter in list views. Upon hover, a tooltip containing a description of the category they represent will appear.</p>
      <h3>User role labels</h3>
      <p>User role labels are different from standard labels. They indicate the permission level of the user and differ visually. User labels lack color, use grayscale text, and have a border.</p>
