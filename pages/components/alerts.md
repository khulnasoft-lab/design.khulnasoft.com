# Alerts

Alerts allow the application to pass along relevant information to the user without impeding their journey. Alerts are not error validations and should not be used as a substitute for errors.

## Usage

| Component type | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| Danger alerts | To be used for critical warnings that require the user's attention. |
| Warning alerts | To be used for other non-critical warnings that require the users attention. |
| Information alerts | To be used to display important information to the user related to their task. |
| Tip alerts | To be used to display tips on using GitLab, new/unused features, and other marketing information. |
| Success alerts | To be used to alert the user that the action they have completed was successful. |
