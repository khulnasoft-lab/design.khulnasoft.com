      <h1>Tags</h1>
      <p>Tags make it possible to show qualitative metadata that are either a system result or used by the system itself. They provide a quick way to identify which object meets certain criteria. There is no click action on a tag as it purely represents metadata itself.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Tags represent system information and are placed near the object that it belongs to in order to strengthen their connection.</p>
      <p>Don't use this component to represent status, quantitative object metadata, or qualitative metadata metadata only meant to be used by humans which is where labels are for.</p>
