      <h1>Tags</h1>
      <p>Tags make it possible to show non-quantitative object metadata that are either a system result or used by the system itself. They provide a quick way to identify which object meets certain criteria. There is no click action on a tag as it purely represents meta data itself.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Tags are used when objects need to show non-quantitative object metadata that are either a system result or used by the system itself. Usage should make sense in terms of context. This means that placement can, for example, be near an ID of an object in order to strengthen the connection that this tag belongs to that object.</p>
      <p>Don't use this pattern to represent status, quantitative object metadata, or non-quantitative object metadata only meant to be used by humans.</p>
