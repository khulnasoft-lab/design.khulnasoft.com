      <h1>Checkmarks</h1>
      <p>A checkmark is an input which communicates that an option is true, false or indeterminate - one is active by default.</p>
      <!-- Usage -->
      <h2>Usage</h2>


      single

      Multiple

      <p>Use checkmarks when there is a choice between two or more selections.  it has a default state, the results are effective and noticable immediately, and there is no need for a user to click a submit button.</p>

      between two opposite states
      allow people to select a number of options

      used when there is a list of options and the user may select multiple options, including all or none.


			<p>Avoid using toggles in for example <a href="/components/forms">forms</a> where a submit button is needed in order to confirm the user's input. This would confuse the user and dillute the expected experience of producing instant results for any toggle throughout the interface.
			<p>Toggles may replace a secgmented control, two radio buttons, or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposing states. In order to help choosing the right solution follow the table below.</p>

			<h3>Labels</h3>
				<p>Toggle labels are set in bold, positioned above the element by default, and should describe what the control will do when the switch is on in a concise, direct, and short way.</p>
			<h3>Visual Design</h3>
			<p>Toggles should use high-contrast colors to indicate the states - On and Off.</p>
