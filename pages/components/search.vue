      <h1>Search</h1>
      <p>Search patterns enable users to trigger a search to find information or filter down a list of information that is already displayed.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>We have three reusable search patterns but they fall into two groups. They’re separated by the way users interact with them and how the search action gets triggered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search by typing</li>
        <li>Search by confirmation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Search by typing</h3>
      <p>This pattern doesn’t have a button and the magnifying glass icon is placed inside and in the left corner of the search box. The search action is triggered immediately after users start typing. The fact that the search is happening in the background needs to be communicated by showing the spinner the right corner of the search box. A clear icon needs to be present if the search box isn’t empty and there is no search activity. Clicking it clears the search box, focuses the input field (if not already focused) and hides itself.</p>
      <p class="todo">Todo: Add live component block with code example (search by typing)</p>
      <h3>Search by confirmation</h3>
      <p>This pattern is visually different from the one above because the users interact with it differently. The magnifying class icon is inside the button which triggers the search action. The presence of the button indicates the need for confirmation to trigger the search. Pressing ”Enter” must also trigger it. A clear icon needs to be present if the search box isn’t empty. Clicking it clears the search box, focuses the input field (if not already focused) and hides itself.</p>
      <p class="todo">Todo: Add live component block with code example (search by confirmation)</p>
      <p>This pattern is commonly used throughout our application in the following form:</p>
      <p class="todo">Todo: Add live component block with code example (search by confirmation with history dropdown)</p>
      <h3>Placeholder</h3>
      <p>Placeholder should either be a generic “Search” or a more specific ”Search projects”. “Filter” can also be used, depending on the use case in question. The search patterns are one of those exceptions where the input field labels aren’t present at all. Because of that, a placeholder should always be there to clearly indicate to users that this is a search box.</p>
