      <h1>Spinner</h1>
      <p>Spinner is a simple animated element that tells users that loading or background activity is in progress.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Spinners attract attention because of their animation so they should be used sparingly. Ideally, only one spinner should be used at a time. If you’re in a position where you think you need more than one, consider using skeleton loading instead.</p>
      <p>Spinners shouldn't be used in combination with skeleton loading (too much animation at once), either one or the other should be used.</p>
      <p>We use three spinner sizes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small</strong>: 16 pixels</li>
        <li><strong>Medium</strong>: 32 pixels</li>
        <li><strong>Large</strong>: 64 pixels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>and three spinner colors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orange</strong>: <code>$orange-600</code></li>
        <li><strong>Dark</strong>: <code>$grey-700</code></li>
        <li><strong>Light</strong>: white</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sizes</h3>
      <h4>Small</h4>
      <p>With its size at 16 pixels this spinner size is perfect for placing it alongside text labels. This is also the size that can be used inside other elements such as buttons or input fields.</p>
      <h4>Medium</h4>
      <p>This size is meant for general usage, general loading tasks.</p>
      <h4>Large</h4>
      <p>This size is the most appropriate for indicating that loading is in progress for whole pages. Always consider using <a href="">skeleton loading</a> instead, it has a positive effect on perceived speed.</p>
      <h3>Colors</h3>
      <h4>Orange</h4>
      <p>This is the primary color for the spinner and it should be used in most cases.</p>
      <h4>Dark</h4>
      <p>This is the secondary color for the spinner. It’s a great alternative for times when the spinner doesn’t need to stand out as much (background activity for example).</p>
      <h4>Light</h4>
      <p>This color is reserved for spinners on dark background only (buttons for example).</p>
