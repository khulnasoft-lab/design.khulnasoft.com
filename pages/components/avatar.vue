        <h1>Avatars</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Avatars are used to represent a unique entity, be it a person, a group, or a project.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>All avatars are displayed using a circular shape and come in a variety of sizes. The size of an avatar varies depending upon the element it resides in as well as the size of the viewport.</p>
      <p>It is preferable that an avatar display an image. Images are personalized and make good use of the ability of the human brain to recognize faces. Project and group avatars contain a fallback in the case an image is not provided. This fallback will display up to two letters based on the name field of the project or group. Personal avatars have a <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> fallback which contains either a configured image or a randomly generated image.</p>
      <h5>Displaying multiple avatars</h5>
      <p>Some features require the display of multiple avatars, side by side. If there is enough space, they should be displayed in a grid pattern. In tighter places, avatars may overlap one another.</p>
