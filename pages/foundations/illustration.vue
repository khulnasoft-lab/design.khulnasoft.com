      <h1>Pagination</h1>
      <p>We use both pagination and infinite scroll to segment content based on the users task. </p>
      <h3>Pagination</h3>
      <p>Pagination breaks up content or data into several pages with a control for navigating to the next or previous page. Pagination aides users who are looking for a specific item(s) in a list and memorize where in that list an items is located.</p>
      <h3>Infinite scroll</h3>
      <p>Infinite scroll gives users an efficient way to browse long lists of content without having to reload the page, allowing users to scroll though long streams of data efficiently.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>We use pagination to breakup content or data into several pages with a control for navigating to the next or previous page. Alternatively, there are instances where infinite scroll provides a better experience to users with browsing tasks. </p>
