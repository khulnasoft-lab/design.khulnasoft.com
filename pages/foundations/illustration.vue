      <h1>Broadcast messages</h1>
      <p>Broadcast messages provide an efficient and prominent way to deliver critical messages at the instance level to all users.</p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>Broadcast messages are always located at the top of the page, above the <a href="/regions/navigation">global navigation</a>. They use a background color that matches the available theme colors but should stand apart to ensure users notice the information.</p>
      <p>Broadcast messages expire after a set period as defined by the admin but they can also be dismissed at the user level.</p>
      <p>It is a rare usecase for multiple broadcast messages to be present at a given time. When this happens, however, the messages should stack.</p>
