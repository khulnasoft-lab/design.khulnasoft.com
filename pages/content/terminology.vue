      <h1>Terminology</h1>
      <p>The following are common terms you will find throughout GitLab. For clear and consistent communication, it is important to use the correct terms.</p>
      <h2>Nouns</h2>
      <h3>Projects &amp; Groups</h3>
      <h4>Project</h4>
      <p>A project is where you house your files (repository), plan your work (issues), and publish your documentation (wiki).</p>
      <h4>Group</h4>
      <p>Groups allow you to assemble related projects together and grant members access to several projects at once. Groups can also be nested in subgroups.</p>
      <h4>Members</h4>
      <p>Use the term members when discussing the people who are a part of a project or a group. Don't use the term users.</p>
      <h4>Roles</h4>
      <p>Users have different abilities depending on the access level they have in a particular group or project. These permission levels are defined under a set of roles. These roles include administrator, owner, master, developer, reporter, and guest.</p>
      <h3>Comments &amp; Discussions</h3>
      <h4>Comment</h4>
      <p>A comment is a written piece of text that users of GitLab can create. Comments have author and timestamp meta data. Comments can be added in a variety of contexts, such as issues, merge requests, and discussions.</p>
      <h4>Discussion</h4>
      <p>A discussion is a group of 1 or more comments. A discussion can include subdiscussions. Some discussions have the special capability of being able to be resolved. Both the comments in the discussion and the discussion itself can be resolved.</p>
      <h3>Issues &amp; Merge Requests</h3>
      <h4>Issues</h4>
      <p>Issues can have endless applications. They allow you, your team, and your collaborators to share and discuss proposals before and while implementing them.</p>
      <h4>Merge Requests</h4>
      <p>Merge requests allow you to exchange changes you made to source code and collaborate with other people on the same project.</p>
      <h4>Milestones</h4>
      <p>Milestones in GitLab are a way to track issues and merge requests created to achieve a broader goal in a certain period of time. Milestones allow you to organize issues and merge requests into a cohesive group, with an optional start date and an optional due date.</p>
      <h4>Activity</h4>
      <p>Activity refers to any action taken by a user that results in the creation of a system note. Commenting, resolving/opening an issue, resolving/opening a merge request, and creating/deleting a branch are all considered to be an activity.</p>
      <h2>Verbs and Adjectives</h2>
      <p>When using verbs or adjectives:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt class="p-b-5"><p>If the context clearly refers to the object, use them alone.</p></dt>
        <dd class="p-t-5 p-b-5"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Edit or Closed</p></dd>
        <dt class="p-t-5 p-b-5"><p>If the context isn’t clear enough, use them with the object.</p></dt>
        <dd class="p-t-5 p-b-5"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Edit issue or Closed issues</p></dd>
        <dt class="p-t-5 p-b-5"><p>Destruction buttons should be clear and always say what they are destroying.</p></dt>
        <dd class="p-t-5 p-b-5"><p><strong>Example:</strong> Delete page instead of just Delete</p></dd>
      </dl>
