      <h1>Voice and tone</h1>
      <p>The copy and messaging is a core part of the experience of GitLab and the conversation with our users. The copy for GitLab is clear and direct. We strike a clear balance between professional and friendly. We can empathize with users (such as celebrating completing all Todos) and remain respectful of the importance of the work. We are a trusted and friendly coworker, helpful and understanding.</p>
      <h2>Brevity</h2>
      <p>Users will skim content, rather than read the text carefully. When familiar with a web app, users rely on muscle memory and may read even less when moving quickly. A good experience should quickly orient a user, regardless of their experience, to the purpose of the current screen. Understanding should happen without the user having to read long strings of text consciously.</p>
      <p>In general, text is burdensome and adds cognitive load. This load is even more pronounced in a powerful productivity tool such as GitLab. We should not rely on words as a crutch to explain the purpose of a screen. The current navigation and composition of the elements on the screen should get the user 95% there, with the remaining 5% being specific elements such as text.</p> 
      <p>Copy should be concise and short whenever possible. A long message or label is a red flag hinting at a design that needs improvement. Preferably use context and placement of controls to make it obvious what clicking on them will do.</p>
