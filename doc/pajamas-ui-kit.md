## Contributions to Pajamas UI Kit

Everyone can contribute to GitLab, including our UI design library in Figma, [Pajamas UI Kit][ui-kit-figma]. To contribute to our Pajamas UI Kit, follow these steps:

1. [Create an issue][new-issue] (or assign yourself an existing one) for the work you’re doing. To create a new component or update an existing one, use the [Figma component issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/issues/new?issuable_template=Figma%20component).
1. Choose one of the following based on your contribution:
   - For changes in the [Pajamas UI Kit][ui-kit-figma], duplicate the file to your drafts.
   - To create a new component, duplicate our [component template][component-template] to your drafts.
   - For all other changes, create a new file in your drafts.
1. Review the [Structure](#structure) section to learn about how we structure and document our work within Figma.
1. Share a link to your draft in the issue.
1. High-five yourself and go brew some coffee while you wait for the review. Thanks!

We accept contributions from wider community members who share a Figma [draft][figma-docs-drafts] with proposed changes. We also encourage design contributions/improvements to GitLab itself — use its [issue tracker][gitlab-issue-tracker] to add your ideas to an existing or new issue.

## Structure

With Figma, components are organized in the asset library by how they are structured and named in the file. The default hierarchy is **File/Page/Frame/Layer**. Depending on the complexity of the component, the slash convention could also be used on the frame. Here’s our working hierarchy for structure and naming, the file name has been left out for brevity:
1. **Page:** [Component]
1. **Frame:** [Category], [Group], or “Variants” (“Variants” is the default frame name)
1. **Layer:** [Breakpoint/Item/Size/State]

* Optional breakpoints (uppercase): XS, SM, MD, LG, XL, breakpoints can also use symbols to indicate range, such as ≥MD or ≤SM
* Optional sizes (lowercase): xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl

For both breakpoints and sizes, numerically prefixing the abbreviations correctly orders them in the asset library in a way that helps a user understand hierarchy (see [examples](#examples) below).

Related components are placed within one parent frame (as opposed to one “floating” frame for each component). For example, all button variations are inside its “Variants” frame. This way, we can link to a single Figma frame as a design spec, in the [Pajamas documentation][pajamas], issues, merge requests, and other places.

We aim to keep the hierarchy [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), and focus on structure specific to component context. If we didn’t put variants within a frame, we’d prevent the naming from being verbose, but it’d be at the cost of not having a specific frame to link to as a design spec.

### Examples

1. **Page:** Icons
1. **Frame:** Actions
1. **Layer:** Export
1. **Result:** Icons/Actions/Export

1. **Page:** Alerts
1. **Frame:** Variants
1. **Layer:** Danger
1. **Result:** Alerts/Variants/Danger

1. **Page:** Pagination
1. **Frame:** Variants
1. **Layer:** ≤MD/Truncated
1. **Result:** Pagination/Variants/≤MD/Truncated

1. **Page:** Badge
1. **Frame:** Variants
1. **Layer:** Info/01 md
1. **Result:** Badge/Variants/Info/01 md

Buttons are an example of something more complex, not because of the component, but because of the amount of variants. Since we prefer to link to one design spec frame, we could have something like this:

1. **Page:** Buttons
1. **Frame:** Variants
1. **Layer:** Info/Primary/Default
1. **Result:** Buttons/Variants/Info/Primary/Default

## Building components

### Base components

Some components are built from *base* components. Base components provide foundational configuration, structure, or other settings for components to be built from. They are not published to the library, because we only want the variants created *from* them to be available for direct use. A change to a base component should propagate to any components built from it. In other systems you may see them called primitives, or master components. We chose “base” to indicate a starting place.

### Elements

With a nod to [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), an *element* is something that cannot be broken down any further, and is primarily used in the construction of other components. In other words, it’s rarely used alone. Since elements can be used and swapped in other components, they’re published to the library. A good example of an element is a checkbox, which could be used in forms with a label, or as part of a multiselect dropdown.

### Variants

A *variant* is the most common form of a component. It is available to use as-is from the asset library, and does not require style overrides, although they may be available. In most cases, the content can be overridden for the context. Variants are often built from a [base component](#base-components), but this isn’t required.

### Using Constraints

Objects within a component will [use constraints][figma-docs-constraints] when they need to maintain their position relative to the component bounds, or content within. Complex, responsive components can be created by combining frames and [layout grids][figma-article-layout-grid]. A tooltip is a good candidate for constraints, so that directional tips can always be placed correctly in relation to the component bounds as the content grows.

### Using Auto Layout

Components with [Auto Layout][figma-docs-auto-layout] dynamically resize based on the content within. This works well for components that need to maintain padding and spacing. With the current Auto Layout capabilities, a good rule of thumb is to use it when the component grows either vertically or horizontally, but not both. A button is a good candidate for Auto Layout, because it can resize horizontally based on label length, and whether or not icons are included.

## Adding descriptions, notes, and annotations

We use three primary methods to add descriptive, helper content for components and design assets in Figma.

1. **Layer**
   - Audience: designers and users of the design file.
   - Use text layers for headings to categorize variants and instances.
   - Use the **Utility/Sticky** component to add a visible note in relation to the design. There are plugins that do similar, but we don’t want to rely on them staying up-to-date. Notes like these should be temporary in nature, and not need to persist.
1. **Comment**
   - Audience: everyone.
   - Use comments to engage with others in a conversation about the design. These conversations can be resolved and will persist as part of the history of the design file.
   - Use comments for annotations on instances, where descriptions are not possible.
   - Use comments when the intended audience may not have edit permissions, since component descriptions are limited to editors at the point of use. This would be beneficial for developer handoff.
1. **Component description**
   - Audience: designers who are referencing or using final components in new designs.
   - Use descriptions to identify the purpose and intended use of the component.
   - Consider using keywords in the description as meta for search. For example, “Keywords: wrench, tool, admin” used for a wrench icon that is used to represent admin in the product.
   - Consider mentioning where the component is used in the product, or for what purpose.
   - Include usage notes that are applicable at the point of use.
   - Keep descriptions short, when possible.

## Publishing changes

Figma library updates are published by a [Figma maintainer][figma-maintainers], regardless of how minor. To support our [transparency value][handbook-transparency], follow these best practices:

* Changes should be reviewed by another designer in a draft before a Maintainer adds it to the Pajamas UI Kit file.
* Before closing the Pajamas UI Kit file, changes should be published so other designers are aware of what’s been changed, and by whom. Because you cannot stage changes like you can with Git, it is important to publish changes so that additional unrelated changes can be published separately.
* Use dashes to list items (no formatting options for the publish message field).

## Plugins

We don’t use plugins for critical actions or capabilities, to avoid making any part of the design process reliant on plugin updates or functionality. Rather, we believe that each user should determine which plugins to use for their own workflow.

That being said, we have put together [a table of plugins][sketch-figma-plugins] we have used in Sketch, along with options in Figma.
