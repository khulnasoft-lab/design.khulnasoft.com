      ## Commit message standards

      One or more commit messages do not meet our Git commit message standards.
      For more information on how to write a good commit message, take a look at
      [Conventional commits](#{URL_CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS}).

      Here is an example of a good commit message:

          feat(progressbar): Improve rendering performance in Edge

          Our progressbar component was causing a lot of re-renders in Edge.
          This was caused by excessive re-rendering due to floating point errors
          in Edge's JavaScript engine.

          By utilizing the better-math library we avoid those calculation errors
          and we can achieve 120 rendering frames per second again.

      This is an example of a bad commit message:

          fixed progressbar

    MARKDOWN
  end

  return if helper.squash_mr?
end

def lint_mr(mr_title)
  return if mr_title.empty?

  semantic_commit = match_semantic_commit(mr_title[/(^WIP: +)?(.*)/, 2])

  if !semantic_commit
    warn(
      'Your MR has **Squash commits when merge request is accepted** enabled but its title does not comply with conventional commits specifications'
    )
  elsif !SEMANTIC_COMMIT_TYPES.include?(semantic_commit[:type])
    warn(
      "The semantic commit type `#{semantic_commit[:type]}` is not a well-known semantic commit type."
    )
  end
end

lint_commits(git.commits)
lint_mr(helper.mr_title) if helper.squash_mr?

if git.commits.length > 10
  warn(
    'This merge request includes more than 10 commits. ' \
      'Please rebase these commits into a smaller number of commits.'
  )
end
