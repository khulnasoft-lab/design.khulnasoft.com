# Pajamas Design System

[GitLab's design system](https://design.gitlab.com/) is our single source of truth (SSOT) for resources, components, and design guidelines. Pajamas pulls in components from [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui), which are in turn used within the product. Our [Figma UI kit](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Pajamas-UI-Kit) is used as a reference for building SSOT components, but is not the SSOT itself.

To learn more about how we create, build, style, and implement components, read the [Component Lifecycle](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/lifecycle/) documentation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 1.10 or newer installed.

### Start using Git on the command line

## Development

### Quick start

1. Clone the project with `git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com.git`
1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
1. Run `yarn install`
1. Run `yarn start` to start build & watch changes
1. Open http://localhost:2018

Alternatively, you can also [open this repository in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/tree/main/) to make and preview changes directly in your browser.

### Conventional commits

We use conventional commits specifications to write meaningful commit messages that are used as part of our semantic release process. [Learn how to write conventional commits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/doc/commits.md).

### Writing component documentation

When starting from scratch:

1. Copy the contents from `pages/components/template.md`
1. Paste the contents in an existing placeholder file in `contents/components/` or create a new file and call it `componentname.md`
1. Edit and write your documentation
1. Include your new page in the navigation. [Learn more about populating the navbar].

### Writing component examples

Component examples can be included in component docs and are available in the **Implementation** tab when they are associated with a documentation page. Component examples should be used over static images whenever possible.

[Learn how to write and use component examples](/doc/component-examples.md).

### Adding images

- When adding images to documentation, wrap the image in a `<figure>` element with a nested `<figcaption>` that explains the figure content in text form for all users.
- If using an `svg` in an `img`, be sure to add `role="img"` to the element.
- The `aria-label` on the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` should be the same content.
- `<figcaption>` is not a replacement for `alt` text, and when an image is present it must contain meaningful `alt` text.

For more background on the following example structure, refer to ["How do you figure?"](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/21/how-do-you-figure.html), by Scott O'Hara.

```
<figure class="figure" role="figure" aria-label="Brief explanation on the figure content (same as figcaption)">
  <img class="figure-img" src="/img/file-name.svg" alt="Description of the visual" role="img" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Brief explanation on the figure content (same as figure aria-label)</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Linting

We control code quality with automatic linting tools like `eslint` and `prettier`.

If you change something in the code, you can run `yarn test` to see if your changes are up-to-code. A lot of failures are auto-fixable, so simply run `yarn run lint:fix` to fix errors automatically.

### Reviewing

Each merge request for this repository will generate a [review app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/). Review apps create a new environment (dynamically) for each one of your branches. A Review App is then visible as a link when you visit the merge request relevant to the branch. That way, you are able to see live all changes introduced by the merge request changes.

## Why is the design system called Pajamas?

Pajamas is a nod to our fully remote culture. In addition, they are comfortable, reliable, and consistent! Read more about how we landed on the name Pajamas in the [original issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/issues/138).
