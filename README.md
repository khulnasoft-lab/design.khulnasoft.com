## Reviewing

Each merge request for this repository will generate a [review app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/). Review apps create a new environment (dynamically) for each one of your branches. A Review App is then visible as a link when you visit the merge request relevant to the branch. That way, you are able to see live all changes introduced by the merge request changes.

## Contributing

GitLab is an open source project and we are very happy to accept community
contributions. Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems while running `yarn` or `yarn start`, they may be due 
to a mismatch between the components installed on your computer and the versions
required by the build scripts in this repository. To fix these problems, try
running `yarn upgrazde`.
