As an open source project, we are very happy to accept community contributions to UX research.

The [UX Research handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research) will give you a better understanding of how we conduct research at GitLab as well as access to UX research resources. If you don't already have an idea for a UX research study, you can browse through our [existing research](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research/#how-to-find-existing-research) as a starting point for inspiration.
