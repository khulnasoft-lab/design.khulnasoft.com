## Structure

<todo>Add structure image for email and UI notifications.</todo>

## Guidelines

Notifications from GitLab appear in two places: in a user's email and in the product, on the To-Do List. The To-Do List items are currently a small, actionable subset of the available notifications.

### When to use

- When a user needs to be made aware of a system action.
- When another user is awaiting a response.
- When there is an important product update a user should be aware of.

### When not to use

- To spam users with non-important details. Avoid overburdening users with non-essential notifications as it leads to fatigue and decreases their ability to be productive within the product.

### Behavior

### Content

### Configuration

Email notification preferences are configured in user settings, under [/profile/notifications](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/notifications).
