description: Guidelines for implementing global search across multiple items and list search for filtering within specific lists.
---

Global search enables users to find items across projects, while list search allows filtering within specific content areas. These search capabilities help users quickly locate relevant information and manage their workflows efficiently.

## Global search

[Global search](https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=&project_id=13083&repository_ref=&scope=issues&search=mobile) allows you to search across items in a project, or even across multiple projects. You can switch tabs to filter on type of object, or filter by group.

## List search

There are several core lists in the GitLab experience, such as the issue list and the merge request list. You are also able to filter and search these lists. [More information regarding filter.](/patterns/filtering)
