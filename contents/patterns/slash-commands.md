## Overview

Slash commands provide a way for the user to efficiently communicate their intent to GitLab Duo Chat. They also allow the user to discover the functionality that GitLab Duo Chat offers. Slash commands are prefixed with `/` and followed by a specific keyword from a predefined list.

## Add slash commands

Be deliberate before you add new slash commands. The list of available commands should be curated to highlight the most valuable interactions.

To avoid unnecessary commands, assess these questions before you implement a new slash command:

- Does the proposed slash command represent a frequently repeated action?
  - What evidence supports this?
- What benefit does the proposed command provide to the user?
- What alternative solutions have you explored?

Before you add an additional slash command, check if the action you want to add could be incorporated in the [existing slash commands](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhNF16eMJBjkCwWOkUg2k-aSuPqH-khjgHrKFSwksJE/edit?usp=sharing). Inform the [Duo Chat group](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#duo-chat-group) when adding a new slash command.

[UX research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/3098) is ongoing to better understand user needs for slash commands.

## Naming convention and syntax

Slash commands should not be tied to specific features. Try to start slash commands with a verb that can apply to multiple contexts.

- Use the same command for different use cases to keep the list small and learnable, instead of a command for a specific feature.
  - **Do**: `/troubleshoot <URL>` Suggest a fix to a vulnerability, code, or pipeline.
  - **Don't**: `/troubleshoot_pipeline <URL>` Suggest a fix for a failing pipeline.
- When a command is more than one word, use an underscore to denote spaces. For example, `/new_conversation`.
- Some commands accept optional arguments, or additional information such as a link, reference, or free text. Slash commands are be formatted in this manner: `/<action verb>` `<optional reference>` `<optional instructions>`. For example, `/summarize #14023 in 5 bullet points`.

## Menu layout

The slash command menu displays the command keyword, optional argument formats, and a brief explanation of the command's application.

## Behavior

- The slash command menu opens by typing `/` in the Duo Chat text input.
- The menu opens above the text input.
- The menu filters as the user types in the input.
- To select a menu item with the keyboard, the user can press <kbd>return</kbd> when the item is focused.
- The menu can be filtered by typing. When the menu is filtered to one item, the user can press <kbd>tab</kbd> to select the item.
- After a menu item is selected:
  - If the command accepts arguments, it fills in the text input.
  - If the command does not accept arguments, it is sent to GitLab Duo Chat.

### Slash commands apply to current context

By default, slash commands should apply to the page the user currently has open, unless specified otherwise by additional arguments. Slash commands should always work without arguments. Avoid requiring the user to input additional information, as it increases mental load to learn syntax and potential to make mistakes.

### Slash command menu depends on current context

Any slash command can be used on any page, with the appropriate arguments. However, the menu of slash commands presented in the UI should only show commands applicable to the page the user is currently viewing. Do not present slash commands in the menu that would not work on the current page.

| Show slash commands in the menu specific to the page the user is currently viewing.                                             | Donâ€™t display slash commands in the menu that would not work on the page the user is currently viewing.                                 |
