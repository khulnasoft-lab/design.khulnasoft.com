## Layout

- **Grid** Rows and columns used to align and snap elements based on sequence and position.
- **Panel**: The basic building block of a dashboard. Each panel is composed of a title, description, and visualization which can be configured or modified through options. Panels can be moved and resized to arrange them within a dashboard.

<todo>Add visual examples for dashboard and panel content and concepts.</todo>

## Guidelines

### When to use

- Display panels of content and data for analysis-oriented tasks.

### When not to use

- If content is action-oriented and presented in a list, table, or board, then a general [landing page](/patterns/navigation#landing-page) may be more appropriate.

### Behavior

The following interactions are available:

- **Alerting**: Enable a panel to notify a user, so they can act on data from their existing data sources.
- **Archive**: Remove something from a current view to be organized and managed in a separate view. This change is recorded in the versioning area.
- **Duplicate**: Create an identical copy of any dashboard or panel.
- **Embed**: Insert panels into different mediums.
- **Export**: Make data available as CSV file, static image of a chart being shown, or static PDF of chart/dashboard (important for data analysis and accessibility).
- **Lock**: One or more elements are temporarily unavailable for changes to be made.
- **Remove**: Delete a dashboard or panel.
- **Share**: Share a dashboard or panel through different channels.
