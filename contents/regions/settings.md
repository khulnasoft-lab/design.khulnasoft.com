Settings allow users to specify preferences for how their instance should behave. Settings should predictable, structured, and display a focused number of options.

There are several settings options with GitLab:

* Admin settings
* User settings
* Project or Group settings
* Feature settings

## Usage

### Placement of settings options

Settings can be accessed through the sidebar [navigation](/regions/navigation), user settings menu, or contextual options in feature pages. 

### Grouping

The options in the settings pages are grouped by categories inside [accordions](/components/accordion). The most frequently used options should be made easily available to users on the page. Horizontal separators are placed between each category to give elements enough room to breathe.

Each group displays a title and a brief explanation of what users should expect when the the accordion is expanded. Use consistent terms and follow the [voice and tone](/content/voice-tone) guidelines. 

### Saving settings

To keep the experience of settings consistent, avoid using a combination of manual and auto-save in form options. Learn more about [saving progress](/product-foundations/saving-and-feedback#saving-progress).
