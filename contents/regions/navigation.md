## Global navigation

Global navigation refers to the top horizontal navigation. The items in the global navigation include a list of pages that allow you to view global content throughout GitLab. For example, you can view your todos, issues, and merge requests across projects and groups. You can also create new groups and projects, as well as search the application.

### GitLab Home Page
The Dashboard is the page users see at the top level of GitLab.com or their instance, and it's where users are directed after logging in. This page is considered navigation, as it is meant to help users orient themselves upon logging in. Currently this page is configurable in User Settings.

### User settings menu
The user settings menu is the rightmost menu which contains items related to the logged-in user.

### Help menu
The help menu is the dropdown with the question mark icon and contains links to docs and support. 

## Contextual navigation
Contextual navigation refers to the left-side sidebar and consists of content that is contextual to each page. These options change depending on if you are looking at a project, a group, or a settings page. There can be up to two levels of navigation. Each sub nav group should be a self-contained group of functionality. For example, everything related to the issue tracker should be under the 'Issues' nav item, while everything relating to the wiki will be grouped under the 'Wiki' nav item. The names used for each section should be short and easy to remember, ideally 1-2 words in length.

### Product Landing Pages
Product landing pages are the top level pages in the contextual navigation for Projects and Groups. For example, the Issue List page is the landing page for issues. Ideally these pages display the most important functionality for that navigation category and when appropriate, facilitate navigation into related functionality.

### Behavior 

- On extra large viewports (`1200px` and up)

The user can choose to have the sidebar always collapsed or expanded. Each time they press the toggle button, a cookie is set to remember their preference.

- On medium and large viewports (`768px` to `1199px`)

There isn't enough room for the main page content to fit comfortably, so the sidebar is collapsed by default, regardless of the user's cookie preference. This is especially important when there is a right sidebar as well (for example, issue detail page) or when there is a lot of horizontal content (for example, pipelines table). When the user expands the sidebar, it overlaps the page instead of pushing the content. In these viewports, the toggle doesn't change the user's cookie, so their preference is only saved and used on extra large viewports.

- On small and extra small viewports (up to `767px`)

The sidebar is hidden behind a “hamburger” icon. When pressed, the sidebar is shown expanded, overlapping the page with a semi-transparent overlay. Like the previous point, this behavior is not affected by the user's cookie preference and doesn't change that preference.
