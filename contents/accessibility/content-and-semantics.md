**Principle:** Check that content is structured, understandable, and is appropriately written for the audience. Ensure that audio and video content is made robust by including alternate formats.</p>

Content can either be the gateway or barrier to understanding and task completion. Concise and plain content benefits all users, regardless of temporary distraction, visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or comprehension levels.

## Plain Language

The following explanation and description is from plainlanguage.gov<sup><a href="#ref-1-src" aria-label="View source 1 details" id="ref-1">1</a></sup>:

Plain language (also called plain writing or plain English) is communication your audience can understand the first time they read or hear it.

The <a class="link-underlined" href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/content-detail.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plain Writing Act of 2010<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a> defines plain language as: “Writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience.“

Language that is plain to one set of readers may not be plain to others. Written material is in plain language if your audience can:

- Find what they need
- Understand what they find
- Use what they find to meet their needs

There are many techniques that can help you achieve this goal. Among the most common are:

- Logical organization with the reader in mind
- “You” and other pronouns
- Active voice
- Short sentences
- Common, everyday words
- Easy-to-read design features

### Expected results

- Headings help to create a scannable outline of the content—both visually and for screen readers
- Headings clearly communicate what users can expect in the section that proceeds
- Heading hierarchy and nesting is semantically correct to aid screen reader navigation, <a class="link-underlined" href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/#finding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey 7 Results<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
- The content guides a user through the page with a logical flow
- The language is familiar to your users and is written at an appropriate comprehension level
- Explanations or definitions are provided for technical terms, unusual words or abbreviations
- Calls to action are clear and avoid ambiguity, e.g. “Discover more about the app“ instead of “Read more“
- Content has been edited to address grammar and spelling issues

## Audio and Video

Audio and video content should have alternate methods to obtain the content. Generally, a text equivalent of audio and video is the best way to ensure the content is accessible. For the hard of hearing user the text can be read on screen and for a user with a sight impairment the text can be read with a screen reader or other assistive technology.

### Expected results

- Transcripts are provided for audio-only media. The transcript can be included on the same page as the audio, linked to or available as an accessible document.
- Transcripts are provided for prerecorded video. The transcript can be included on the same page as the video, linked to or available as an accessible document. In some cases an audio track that includes equivalent information is used in place of a transcript.
- Closed captioning is provided for all video, including live webcasts and webinars
- Audio descriptions can be helpful to explain what‘s happening in a video, but aren‘t required (<a class="link-underlined" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7j4_aP8dWA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See Example<span class="ext-ref">(external link)</span><span aria-hidden="true"></span></a>)
- Audio and video should not autoplay
