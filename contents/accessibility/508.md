name: GitLab Accessibility Conformance Report Revised Section 508 Edition
---

**Based on Version 2.4Rev**, March 2022 ([template](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat))

- **Name of Product/Version:** GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium version 16.0
- **Report Date:** Revised July, 2023
- **Product Description:** From project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a single application for [the entire DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).
- **Contact information:** [ux@gitlab.com](mailto:ux@gitlab.com)
- **Notes:**
  - This evaluation only refers to GitLab the product and does not include the [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/) websites.
  - The latest revision evaluates **GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium version 16.0** and supersedes earlier versions of this report.
  - **Table 3: Success Criteria, Level AAA** has been removed because the GitLab product has not been evaluated for WCAG 2.0 Level AAA conformance.
  - **Chapter 4: Hardware** has been removed because the GitLab product is a web application and is not subject to the requirements of this section.
  - GitLab supports the current and previous major version along with current minor version of the following browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge.
  - GitLab does not support running with JavaScript disabled in the browser because several features require JavaScript extensively.
  - View [GitLab installation minimum requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html) for both the supported operating systems and the minimum requirements needed to install and use GitLab.
  - Known accessibility issues are linked in the tables below and may also be found by searching [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) (account required).
- **Evaluation Methods Used:** Conformance to the listed accessibility standards has been evaluated by GitLab using a combination of analysis tools and manual testing with assistive technologies. These tools include, but are not limited to: [axe DevTools®](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/), [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/), and VoiceOver on macOS.
