name: GitLab Accessibility Conformance Report WCAG Edition
---

**Based on Version 2.5**, November 2023 ([template](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat))

- **Name of Product/Version:** GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium version 17.0
- **Report Date:** Revised June, 2024
- **Product Description:** From project planning and source code management to CI/CD and monitoring, GitLab is a single application for [the entire DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).
- **Contact information:** [ux@gitlab.com](mailto:ux@gitlab.com)
- **Notes:**
  - This evaluation only refers to GitLab the product and does not include the [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/) websites.
  - The latest revision evaluates **GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium version 17.0** and supersedes earlier versions of this report.
  - **Table 3: Success Criteria, Level AAA** has been removed because the GitLab product has not been evaluated for WCAG 2.2 Level AAA conformance.
  - GitLab supports the current and previous major version along with current minor version of the following browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge.
  - GitLab does not support running with JavaScript disabled in the browser because several features require JavaScript extensively.
  - View [GitLab installation minimum requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html) for both the supported operating systems and the minimum requirements needed to install and use GitLab.
  - Known accessibility issues are linked in the tables below and may also be found by searching [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/) (account required).
- **Evaluation Methods Used:** Conformance to the listed accessibility standards has been evaluated by GitLab using a combination of analysis tools and manual testing with assistive technologies. These tools include, but are not limited to: [axe DevToolsÂ®](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/), [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/), and VoiceOver on macOS.

## Terms

The terms used in the Conformance Level information are defined as follows:

- **Supports:** The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.
- **Partially Supports:** Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.
- **Does Not Support:** The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.
- **Not Applicable:** The criterion is not relevant to the product.
- **Not Evaluated:** The product has not been evaluated against the criterion. This can only be used in WCAG Level AAA criteria.

## WCAG 2.x Report

<note>When reporting on conformance with the WCAG 2.x Success Criteria, they are scoped for full pages, complete processes, and accessibility-supported ways of using technology as documented in the [WCAG 2.0 Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs).</note>
