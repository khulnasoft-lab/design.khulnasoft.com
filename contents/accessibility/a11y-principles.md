It is [GitLab's mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/) to make it so that everyone can contribute.

When everyone can contribute, users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation.

[Diversity, inclusion and belonging](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion) are fundamental to the success of GitLab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute.

**Accessibility**
: Provide access to content and functionality that enables consumption and contribution for everyone.
: Accessibility isn’t a feature, it’s a necessity.

**Disabilities**
: Disabilities include visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. They can be temporary, situational, or permanent.

### Provide comparable experience

Ensure your interface provides a comparable experience for all so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality of the content.

### Consider situation

People use your interface in different situations. Make sure your interface delivers a valuable experience to people regardless of their circumstances.

### Be consistent

Use familiar conventions and apply them consistently.

### Give control

Ensure people are in control. People should be able to access and interact with content in their preferred way.

### Offer choice

Consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks, especially those that are complex or non-standard.

### Prioritize content

Help users focus on core tasks, features, and information by prioritizing them within the content and layout.

### Add value

Consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users.
