We aim to provide access to content and functionality that enables consumption and contribution for everyone. In support of [our mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/) and [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) we've included the Inclusive Design Principles from [inclusivedesignprinciples.org](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) here as a reference to help inform our work and process.

>These Inclusive Design Principles are about putting people first. It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities — all of us really.

In combination with our [product principles](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#our-product-principles), thoughtful consideration of the following will yield actionable requirements, meaningful constraints, helpful insights, and attainable goals that benefit the experience at hand for all users.

## Provide comparable experience

Ensure your interface provides a comparable experience for all so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality of the content.

…

## Consider situation

People use your interface in different situations. Make sure your interface delivers a valuable experience to people regardless of their circumstances.

…

## Be consistent

Use familiar conventions and apply them consistently.

…

## Give control

Ensure people are in control. People should be able to access and interact with content in their preferred way.

…

## Offer choice

Consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks, especially those that are complex or non-standard.

Offering choice is about _access_, not options or feature bloat. Per our [convention over configuration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#convention-over-configuration) product principle, "we believe however that more options are not necessarily better, and that our users are better served by an application with reduced complexity yet still contains the features they need."

## Prioritize content

Help users focus on core tasks, features, and information by prioritizing them within the content and layout.

…

## Add value

Consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users.
