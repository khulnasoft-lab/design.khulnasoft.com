## Library updates

If you have any of the available libraries enabled in a file you’ll occasionally see a toast message in Figma notifying you that there are updates to those library assets. You can choose to update items individually or in a batch.

Not all updates will be desireable or immediately needed however, and some may even introduce [breaking changes](/devops/breaking-changes). For that reason it’s recommended to review the release notes. If you’re still uncomfortable with how your work might be impacted, first make a duplicate of your file and test the updates there or ask a maintainer.
