Everyone can contribute to GitLab, including our UI design library in Figma. To contribute to our Pajamas UI Kit, follow these steps:

1. [Create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/issues/new) (or assign yourself an existing one) for the work you’re doing. To create a new component or update an existing one, use the [Figma component issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Figma%20update).
1. Choose one of the following based on your contribution:
   - If you’re making updates or breaking changes to an existing component in the Pajamas UI Kit, start with a [branch](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/) of the UI kit. Prefix the branch name with the issue, MR, or epic number, and add your GitLab username as the suffix. For example, **#860-table-component-updates-lvanc**.
   - To create a new component, duplicate our [component template](https://www.figma.com/file/OmvFfWkqEsdGhXAND133ou/Component-template?node-id=0%3A1) to your drafts.
   - For all other changes, create a new file in your drafts.
1. Review the **Figma Guides** section to learn about how we structure and document our work within Figma.
1. Share a link to your branch or draft in the issue.
1. High-five yourself and go brew some coffee while you wait for the review. Thanks!

We accept contributions from wider community members who share a Figma [draft](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041543473#drafts) with proposed changes.

We also encourage design contributions/improvements to GitLab itself — use its [issue tracker][gitlab-issue-tracker] to add your ideas to an existing or new issue and refer to this guide on [design and user interface changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/design.html#design-and-user-interface-changes).
