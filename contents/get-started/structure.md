Our design system is broken down into the following sections:

## Foundations

Foundations represent perceptual patterns. These are less tangible aspects of the design system. Together they create a certain aesthetic for the product. Examples include colors, typography, and icons.

## Components

Components are the reusable building blocks of the interface. Examples include buttons, tabs, and input fields.

## Regions

Regions are areas of the application that are formed by combining multiple components. Examples of this include the global header and contextual sidebar.

## Objects

[Objects](/objects/overview) are the high-level building blocks of the product. Objects can be sketched out to describe how the product fits together. Examples include Issuables, Groups, and Reports.

## Content

Content includes documentation relating to our writing style. This includes the tone and voice of the brand, as well as common grammar guidelines.

## Usability

Usability guidelines include documentation that affects the ease-of-use for different types of users. This includes accessibility and internationalization.

## Resources

Our resources section contains relevant and useful links that aide in the creation of our design system, as well as GitLab design as a whole.
