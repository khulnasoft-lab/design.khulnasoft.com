## Design project

In progress design files are stored in the [GitLab Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design) project and maintained by GitLab UX designers. The repository contains GitLab’s prototypes and work-in-progress files. The Pajamas UI Kit can be found in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Pajamas-UI-Kit---Beta).

### Goals

- Jumpstart design work by using the pattern library and existing working files
- Enable frequent, stable, and consistent contributions
- Make GitLab’s design open, transparent, and open source
- Facilitate design handoffs and design–development communication design handoffs.

The project is primarily used by GitLab’s UX Design department to host design files and hand them off for implementation. To learn about the best practices to manage the project, including the repository’s organization, check out the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Using the UI kit to contribute to GitLab features

If you decide to contribute to GitLab by proposing a design for a feature, we recommend that you use the Pajamas UI Kit for final designs. Follow these steps to add the kit to your Figma library:

**Supported Figma plans: Professional/Education, Organization, and Enterprise**
- Add the Pajamas UI Kit to your drafts by opening the File name menu > File menu > Duplicate to Drafts. 
- Enable the library from your drafts by following [these steps](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038743434).
- All components and styles will be accessible in any Figma file you use. In order to stay updated with library changes, re-duplicate the Pajamas UI Kit once a month and add it as a library again to ensure the components and styles are up-to-date.

**Starter Figma plan**
Starter plans can only create and publish styles from drafts. This means the components will not be available within your library.
- Add the Pajamas UI Kit styles to your drafts by opening the File name menu > File menu > Duplicate to Drafts. 
- Enable the styles in the library from your drafts by following [these steps](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038743434).
- All styles will be accessible in any Figma file you use. In order to stay updated with style changes, re-duplicate the Pajamas UI Kit once a month and add it as a library again to ensure the styles are up-to-date.

## GitLab SVG project

All GitLab SVG assets (icons and illustrations) are managed in the [GitLab SVG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs) project. This project automates creating an SVG sprite out of icons and optimizing SVG based illustrations.

We built an [online viewer](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/) of our GitLab SVGs that allows exploring and searching our icon library.
