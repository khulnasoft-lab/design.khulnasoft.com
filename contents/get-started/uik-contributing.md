To contribute to any of the [libraries](get-started/uik-file-structure) in the Pajamas UI kit, first check if an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues) exists in the issue tracker. If an issue does not yet exist, it can be helpful to create one, using the `Figma update` template. This template provides a helpful checklist to help you as you work. 

Create a branch in the Figma libary, and include the issue number in the branch name. After you've completed the checklist on the `Figma update` template, request a review from a [Figma maintainer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/.gitlab/CODEOWNERS#L18).

When requesting a review, ensure that your description is exactly what you would want to appear in the [release notes](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/uik-release-notes), as the release notes are automatically generated from Figma descriptions.
