Our design system is organized into the following sections:

## [Foundations](/product-foundations/)

Foundational items communicate the opinionated way in which basic visual design attributes, elements, and concepts come together to create a distinct GitLab personality thatâ€™s expressed in the UI. For example, color, typography, and iconography.

## [Components](/components/)

A component is a UI element that serves a singular purpose or function. Two or more simple components can combine to form a composite component that still has a single function. For example, an avatar, button, or combobox.

## [Patterns](/patterns/)

A pattern combines components and/or content elements into a repeatable, consistent group that has a shared purpose, content association, or both. For example, filtering, forms, or navigation.

## [Objects](/objects/)

An object is a conceptual building block or concept that defines how we think about something independent of its visual representation or interaction model. For example, a job, merge request, or repository.

## [Data visualization](/data-visualization/)

Data visualizations pull insights from data sets into a narrative and allow users to explore data themselves to discover their own insights.

## [Content](/content/)

Guidelines for crafting clear, consistent, and universal content. It addresses key elements of language and localization in user interface design and content creation for GitLab.

## [Usability and interaction](/usability/)

Guidelines that apply to the user experience for GitLab.
