name: Principles

Principles act as a reusable standard for teams to measure their work. They replace subjective ideals with a shared understanding of what the result must do for users. Just as guardrails keep you safe and on the road, principles keep teams on the path to achieving their vision. By achieving alignment, principles enable us to scale and build velocity.

There are two kinds of principles; The principles that guide the process and principles that define the output. The process principles are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

Each principle has been assigned a hierarchy position to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance while remaining consistent.

We take inspiration from other companies though our principles are defined by looking inward. This helps to determine which are most actionable and effective. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our principles and strive always to make them better. Our principle guidelines are defined at the bottom of this page, so everyone is welcome to suggest improvements by opening an issue and/or creating a merge request in our [repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com)!

## 1 Enable productivity

GitLab is a platform that supports people in their daily work. We respect the importance of their efforts and avoid unnecessary gimmicks. By embracing [sophisticated simplicity](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#aiming-towards-sophisticated-simplicity), we make thoughtful choices that streamline complex workflows and functionality, allowing users to stay focused on what matters most.

| Ensure content is easily discoverable. | Force people to search around for what they need. |
| Provide the features people need to achieve their goals, and ensure they function as expected.  |  Leave people without access to the features they need to complete their goals. |
| Make all content as clear and straightforward as possible. | Overcomplicate with excessive explanation or configuration options. |

## 2 Goals over tasks

Empathy for our customers starts with a deep understanding of their needs and goals, not just the tasks they're trying to accomplish. Rather than focusing on isolated actions, we aim to support their overall workflows. Designing with this mindset ensures that we're creating a more connected and coherent experience across the product.

| Do                                                                                                                                              | Don't                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design with the customer's end goal in mind.  |  Focus solely on individual tasks. |
| Treat features as interconnected parts of the experience. | Think about features in isolation.  |
| Maintain consistency across the product. | Re-invent the wheel. |

## 3 Transparent over opaque

[Transparency](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency) is both a Pajamas design principle and a value of GitLab itself. Our design decisions should strive to increase clarity and foster confidence in the product. People should understand the rationale behind system behaviors, actions, and recommendations so they are empowered to make informed decisions. This is especially important when interacting with complex products or newer technologies.

| Do                                                                                                                                              | Don't                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clearly explain how recommendations are generated, especially with [AI features](/usability/ai-human-interaction#be-transparent). | Omit explanations for recommendations to simplify the experience. |
| Communicate the status of processes happening in the background. | Only communicate about processes happening in the foreground, as a direct result of the user's actions. |
| Ensure people have all of the information they need to proceed with confidence. | Leave questions unanswered just to minimize the UI. |
