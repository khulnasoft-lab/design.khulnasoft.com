Principles act as a reusable standard for teams to measure their work. They replace subjective ideals with a shared understanding of what the result must do for users. Just as guardrails keep you safe and on the road, principles keep teams on the path to achieving their vision. By achieving alignment, principles enable us to scale and build velocity.

There are two kinds of principles; The principles that guide the process and principles that define the output. The process principles are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

We take inspiration from other companies though our principles are defined by looking inward. This helps to determine which are most actionable and effective. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our principles and strive always to make them better. Our principle guidelines are defined at the bottom of this page, so everyone is welcome to suggest improvements by opening an issue and/or creating a merge request in our [repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com)!

## Sophisticated simplicity

GitLab is a platform that supports people in their daily work. We respect the importance of their efforts and avoid unnecessary gimmicks. To that end, we work towards [sophisticated simplicity](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#aiming-towards-sophisticated-simplicity) in our product. We do this by making thoughtful choices that streamline complex workflows and functionality, allowing users to stay focused on what matters most.

There are three principles that help support us in this work.

### Prioritize the platform

Though the platform is made of many tools, everything should function seamlessly together. Designing with this mindset ensures that we're creating a more connected and coherent experience across the product.

| Do                                                                                                                                              | Don't                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Optimize connections between capabilities. | Optimize for an isolated use of tools.  |
| Use patterns consistently across the platform. | Use different patterns based on product area.  |
| Optimize the broader user journey, even when it crosses product groups, or when you're focused on a particular step. | Optimize for individual interactions or features.  |

### Support learning

Users should be able to interact and explore in ways that promote learning and proficiency while minimizing mistakes.

| Do                                                                                                                                              | Don't                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clearly explain how recommendations are generated, especially with [AI features](/usability/ai-human-interaction#be-transparent). | Omit explanations for recommendations to simplify the experience. |
| Communicate the status of processes happening in the background. | Only communicate about processes happening in the foreground, as a direct result of the user's actions. |
| Ensure people have all of the information they need to proceed with confidence. | Delegate key information to the documentation to minimize the UI. |

### Focus on outcomes

Empathy for the user starts with a deep understanding of their needs and goals. Rather than focusing on isolated actions or on the discrete features used to complete specific tasks, we aim to support the broader outcomes they seek to achieve.

| Do                                                                                                                                              | Don't                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Focus on the user's intended outcomes, and on what they seek to ultimately achieve. |  Focus on the implementation of trending features to drive adoption and visibility in the market. |
| Prioritize user value. | Prioritize technical feasibility or development speed. |
| Design for current essential needs. | Design to accomodate future, potential needs. |
