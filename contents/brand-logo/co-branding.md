name: Co-branding

Co-branded lockups are created by the Brand Design team for approved GitLab partnerships, events, and campaigns. We default to the partner company’s co-branding lockup standards, but adhere to the following when such standards do not exist:

- Use the core GitLab logo.
- Ensure both logos are visually equal in size.
- Insert a gray line (Gray 03) between the logos equal to the height of the GitLab logo.
- Center both logos vertically; the company’s logo should not exceed the height of the tanuki.

Ensure the clear space (x-height equal to the height of the a from our wordmark) around all sides of both logos
