## Tanuki

The logomark personifies GitLab’s values, culture, and stewardship of open source, taking inspiration from the tanuki – a raccoon dog native to Japan.

The tanuki is known for being fast, efficient, and collaborative. It is thought to symbolize trustworthiness, agility, and preparedness. Known for its transformational powers and collaborative nature, the tanuki works with others to achieve a common goal – a behavior that is also embodied by GitLab’s mission that everyone can contribute.

The tanuki logomark can be used when the core logo has already been presented to provide context. It should never be obscured or hard to recognize.

## Construction

DevOps is at our core, and the logomark represents adaptability, iteration, development, and – like the DevOps loop – momentum.

The construction of the GitLab tanuki was based on an infinity loop, representing the limitless possibilities of The DevSecOps Platform.

## Clear space

Like the logo, the clear space for the tanuki logomark is measured by the x-height, which equals the height of the letter "a" from the wordmark.

Ensuring proper clear space between the logomark and surrounding elements preserves the visual integrity of our brand; this area should be kept free of any visual elements, including text, graphics, borders, patterns, and other logos.

## Variations

The logomark should be used in full color by default, but there are times when a one color variation can be used. Consider the following:

- Default to full color usage for brand awareness.
- Charcoal or white should be the second alternative to full color. Consider these options when brand presence is already well-established or when usage is restricted to a single color.
- Orange 02p, Purple 01p, and Purple 02p are the other single color exceptions. These can be used occasionally and with discretion. Some examples include: an orange tanuki for browser favicons or a purple tanuki on swag for a pop of color. 
- Note: If you need to use the tanuki in a color other than what is listed above, please [reach out to the brand team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#contacting-the-team) for approval.
