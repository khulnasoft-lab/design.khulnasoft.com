name: Layers

Layers addresses dimensional hierarchy and content relationships â€” not just top-down or scale, but also depth (z-index) and dynamic changes based on state or overflow. Visual styles and affordance that indicate depth, content boundaries, and state are also encompassed within layers.

## Shadows

### Small

#### Base

![sm shadow](/img/layers/sm-shadow.png)

#### Definition

Surfaces that need an indication they can be manually interacted with. For example, cards in issue boards.

#### Components

* [Card](/components/card)
* *Components with shadow boundaries*

#### Attributes

* Passive, defines surface bounds when on a white backgrounds.
* Indicates surface can be interacted with.

#### Style

box-shadow:<br>0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08),<br>0px 0px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);

### Medium

#### Base

![md shadow](/img/layers/md-shadow.png)

#### Definition

Surfaces that need boundary definition and appear on hover. For example, [popovers](/components/popover).

#### Components

* [Popover](/components/popover)
* *Stacked elevation components*

#### Attributes

* Surfaces that appear on hover.
* Components layered above other components. Stacked layers and static components that have content that scrolls beneath.

#### Style

box-shadow:<br>0px 0px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16),<br>0px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16);

### Large

#### Base

![lg shadow](/img/layers/lg-shadow.png)

#### Definition

Surfaces with elevation that appear as a result of a user/system action. For example, when dragging a card on an issue board.

#### Components

* [Toast](/components/toast)
* [Card](/components/card) on drag

#### Attributes

* Components in motion.

#### Style

box-shadow:<br>0px 0px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16),<br>0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16);

## Stacking & overflowing layers

Layers that need to appear above a layer with an existing elevation should follow the stacking guidelines. By default, these stacked layers will use the md-shadow.

### Use case

- Content scrolls beneath static elements

## Interactive layers

Layers that can be moved or dragged by the user use the lg shadow to create a greater sense of depth in the UI and define the element from other elements that may have an existing elevation.
