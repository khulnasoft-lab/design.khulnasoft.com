## Configuration

The ability to configure features by disabling unwanted functionality is possible at the project level. Admin users cannot disable features at the instance level, as they do not know what functionality end users may use.

## Feature discovery moments

Feature discovery moments are notices presented in the UI that inform users of additional features available in higher tiers. These notices are contextual, immediately dismissable, and temporary by default. Once dismissed, the notice does not reappear unless a change in behavior or a predefined passage of time has occurred. Contextual notices relate directly to an action that a user or namespace has performed.

When planning a discovery moment consider the following:

* Why this feature needs to be promoted? Is it a value driver and reportedly leads to an increase in conversion?
* If a feature is already being promoted on the page, how does it perform? Will the new notice directly compete with it?
* If two features need a discovery moment, can they be bundled into one? (If they are part of the same Job To be Done for example.)

Use input data to determine where, when and why a feature discovery moment is needed. After introducing a feature discovery moment, measure its effect on both conversion and feature adoption before making it a permanent part of the product.
