## Configuration

The ability to configure features by disabling unwanted functionality is possible at the project level. Admin users cannot disable features at the instance level, as they do not know what functionality end users may use.

## Upgrade notifications

Upgrade notifications alerting users of paid features are contextual, dismissable, and temporary by default. Contextual notifications relate directly to an action that a user has performed.
