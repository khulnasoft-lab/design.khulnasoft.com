## Configuration

The ability to configure features by disabling unwanted functionality is possible at the project level. Admin users cannot disable features at the instance level, as they do not know what functionality end users may use.

## Discovery moments

Feature discovery moments are notices presented in the UI that inform users of additional features available in higher tiers. These notices are contextual, immediately dismissable, and temporary by default. Once dismissed, the notice does not reappear unless a change in behavior or a predefined passage of time has occurred. Contextual notices relate directly to an action that a user or namespace has performed.
