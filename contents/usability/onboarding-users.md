intro, when showing users how to do something and what the value of it is we're essentially helping them with two things: ability and motivation (FOGG). Prompts are the ones that trigger the desired behavior but for that to happen, ability and motivation need to be high enough. https://behaviormodel.org/

initial nudges (table?)
* popover - very intrusive, but more effective; no major changes to UI required
* banner - less intrusive but also less effective; might require significant changes to the UI (displacement of default elements for example)
* UI modification - not really a pattern, can be used in combination with the other two. Generally requires more work but can be less intrusive and still effective.

recommendation on the number of steps: 3, 5 should be the maximum

recommendations for writing copy and providing context:
* why the nudge is shown,
* what value will the user get from it
* avoid generic CTA copy like “Let’s go” or “Show me how”. Use something that will tell the user what value they’ll get out of it so that even if they only scan the copy of the nudge, they’ll have a good idea of what it is they’re doing and what the result will be. Good example ”Show me how to add a pipeline”


should only be done with user's benefit in mind
* think about what value you're trying to give to user and work backwards from that. So having a new feature that you want to show alone isn't a good reason for a nudge. What is the value of the new feature? How will the user benefit from that? If you can't find good answers to these questions, you probably shouldn't use the nudge.
* always give users an option to opt out, a simple “No, thanks.” button should do.
