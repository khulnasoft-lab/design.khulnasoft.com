## Heirarchy

- Different ways to show the Work Item 'Object' hierarchy include breadcrumbs on the item and a child tree widget.
- Lists should be simple, easy-to-use ways to access individual work items.
- Boards can be used to visualize the progression or status of work.
- Keep lists and boards as 'flat' views, without nesting the UI or emphasizing the parent-child hierarchy.
- Use Grid views to effectively visualize the entire relationship tree.
