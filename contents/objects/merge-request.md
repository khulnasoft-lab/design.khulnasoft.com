name: Merge request

A merge request (MR) is one of the core product objects, where users collaborate on proposed changes to source code.
From editing, reviewing, testing, and deploying, almost everything in GitLab flows through MRs.
[How are MRs used in the product?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)

## Layouts

MR attributes and actions can be embedded in related objects that rely on specific layouts. For example, an issue or pipeline. 

The main representation of an MR is the **record** layout.
Below is the semantic layout of the combination between the MR object and the record layout.
