A mini pipeline graph is a visualization of a CI/CD pipeline. 

## Usage

A mini pipeline graph can be used in different layouts throughout the product as a way to monitor the pipeline run and navigate between the pipelines stages and jobs.

### When to use

- Communicate the status of the different pipeline stages and jobs in one place.

### When not to use

- To display the status of the whole pipeline. A pipeline status badge should be used in that case.

## Demo
