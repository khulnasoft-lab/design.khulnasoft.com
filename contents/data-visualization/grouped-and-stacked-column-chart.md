## Usage

Column charts are used to compare values across categories. The categories are usually presented on the x-axis, with the values on the y-axis.

## Variants

### Stacked

### Grouped

### Symmetric grouped and stacked

Symmetric grouped and stacked column charts display two dimensions of data (one nested within another) moving across a time series. The number of stacks in a symmetric grouped and stacked column chart is equal as opposed to the [asymmetric grouped and stacked column chart](/data-visualization/column-charts/asymmetric-grouped-and-stacked).

Todo: Add symmetric example

There are three dimensions of data displayed on symmetric grouped and stacked column charts:
- **Groups**: The first dimension is represented by a group of columns.
- **Stacks**: The second nested dimension is represented as a stacked column.
- **Series**: The time series is represented across the X-axis.

*Note: Try to avoid using more than 5 values in each dimension to prevent visaul complexity in the charts.*

#### Color patterns

See [color](/data-visualization/color/) for a full description of data visualization color patterns.

##### Cross-column colors

Use to highlight the relationship of the dimension spanning across columns.

Todo: Add example

##### Graded transparency

Use to highlight the relationship of the dimension in the same stacked column while differentiating between other stacked columns.

Todo: Add example

##### Specific colors

Use sparingly. For example, when the values in the chart have specific colors associated with them (for example, Merge Request state or Vulnerability status).

### Asymmetric grouped and stacked

Asymmetric grouped and stacked column charts display two dimensions of data (one nested within another) moving across a time series. The number of stacks in an asymmetric grouped and stacked column chart is not equal as opposed to the [symmetric grouped and stacked column chart](/data-visualization/column-charts/symmetric-grouped-and-stacked).

Todo: Add asymmetric example

There are three dimensions of data displayed on asymmetric grouped and stacked column charts:
- **Groups**: The first dimension is represented by a group of columns.
- **Stacks**: The second nested dimension is represented as a stacked column.
- **Series**: The time series is represented across the X-axis.

*Note: Try to avoid using more than 5 values in each dimension to prevent visaul complexity in the charts.*
