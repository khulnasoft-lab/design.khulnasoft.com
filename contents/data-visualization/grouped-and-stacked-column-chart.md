Grouped and stacked column charts

## Usage

Grouped and stacked column charts typically represent two [categories](https://design.gitlab.com/data-visualization/color#categorical-data) (one nested within another) moving across a time series:
- **Groups**: The first category is represented by a group of columns.
- **Stacks**: The second nested category is represented as a stacked column.
- **Series**: The time series is represented across the X-axis.

## Variants

There are two types of grouped and stacked charts:
- **Symmetric**: The number of stacks in each column is equal.
- **Asymmetric**: The number of stacks in each column is not equal.

*Note: For both symmetric and asymmetric variants, try to avoid using more than 5 values in each category.*

### Symmetric

### Asymmetric

Todo: Add asymmetric example

## Color

Colors patterns can apply to both symmetric and asymmetric chart variants.

- **Cross-column colors**: Use to highlight the relationship of the same stack category across different columns
- **Graded transparency**: Use to highlight the relationship between the category in the same stacked column and differentiate with other stacked columns
- **Specific colors**: Use sparingly when the values in the chart have specific colors associated with them (for example, Merge Request state or Vulnerability status)
