Grouped and stacked column charts display two dimensions of data (one nested within another) moving across a time series.

## Usage

There are three dimensions of data displayed on grouped and stacked column charts:
- **Groups**: The first dimension is represented by a group of columns.
- **Stacks**: The second nested dimension is represented as a stacked column.
- **Series**: The time series is represented across the X-axis.

## Variants

There are two types of grouped and stacked charts:
- **Symmetric**: The number of stacks in each column is equal.
- **Asymmetric**: The number of stacks in each column is not equal.

*Note: For both symmetric and asymmetric variants, try to avoid using more than 5 values in each dimension to prevent visaul complexity in the charts.*

### Symmetric

Todo: Add symmetric example

### Asymmetric

Todo: Add asymmetric example

## Color

Colors patterns can apply to both symmetric and asymmetric chart variants.

- **Cross-column colors**: Use to highlight the relationship of the dimension spanning across columns.
- **Graded transparency**: Use to highlight the relationship of the dimension in the same stacked column while differentiating between other stacked columns.
- **Specific colors**: Use sparingly. For example, when the values in the chart have specific colors associated with them (for example, Merge Request state or Vulnerability status).

See [color](/data-visualization/color/#categorical-data) for a full description of data visualization color patterns.
