The single stat component displays the title and value of a metric.

## Usage

A single stat can be used by itself or side-by-side with other single stats to display a topical set of metrics. There are a number of variations to allow for additional context or representation of the metric.

### When to use a single stat

- To show an overview of how a metric is performing.
- To show multiple metrics around a similar topic side-by-side.

### When not to use single stat

- To display standard text or labels.
- To display the same metric over a period of time (use a [chart](/data-visualization/charts) instead).

## Demo

### Simple

The default pattern for displaying a metric.

<story-viewer component="charts-single-stat" title="Default" :args-value="100000" ></story-viewer>

### Title icon

A single stat with a title icon to convey extra meaning to the metric.

<story-viewer component="charts-single-stat" story="with-title-icon" title="With Title Icon"></story-viewer>

### Meta icon

A single stat with an icon which can be used to convey status or trend.

<story-viewer component="charts-single-stat" story="with-meta-icon" title="With Meta Icon"></story-viewer>

### Badge

<story-viewer component="charts-single-stat" story="with-meta-icon" title="With Badge" args-variant="info" args-meta-text="through the roof" args-meta-icon="rocket"></story-viewer>
