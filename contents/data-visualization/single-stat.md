The single stat component displays the title and value of a metric.

## Usage

A single stat can be used by itself or side-by-side with other single stats to display a topical set of metrics. There are a number of variations to allow for additional context or representation of the metric.

### When to use a single stat

- To show an overview of how a metric is performing.
- To show multiple metrics around a similar topic side-by-side.

### When not to use single stat

- To display standard text or labels.
- To display the same metric over a period of time (use a [chart](/data-visualization/charts) instead).

## Demo
