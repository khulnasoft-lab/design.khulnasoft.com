Copy and messaging are meaningful aspects of the GitLab experience and the conversation with our users.

The copy for GitLab is clear and direct. We strike a balance between professional and friendly. We can empathize with users (such as celebrating completing all items on the To-Do List) while remaining respectful to the importance of their work. We are a trusted, friendly, helpful, and understanding coworker.

We use [active voice](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#active-voice) as much as possible, and we write [from the customer perspective](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#customer-perspective). We use [contractions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/index.html#contractions), but we don't use [Latin abbreviations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#writing-for-localization).

Guidance for UI text is similar to guidance for the product documentation. You can find guidance for text on the page for each component. Additional guidance is also available in the following sections on this page.

In addition, you can view the [style guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/), the [word list](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/word_list.html), or ask a technical writer for help.

## Brevity

Users will skim content, rather than read text carefully. Copy should be concise and short whenever possible. A long message or label is a red flag hinting at a design that needs improvement.

When familiar with a web app, users rely on muscle memory and may read even less when moving quickly. A good experience should quickly orient a user, regardless of their experience, to the purpose of the current screen. Understanding should happen without the user having to consciously read long strings of text.

In general, text is burdensome and adds cognitive load. This load is even more pronounced in a powerful productivity tool such as GitLab. We shouldn’t rely on words as a crutch to explain the purpose of a screen. Instead, the current navigation and composition of on-screen elements should get the user 95% there, with the remaining 5% being specific elements such as text.

Brevity is especially important for:

- Headers
- Button text
- Field labels
- Error messages

For each of these content types, look for ways you might rephrase text that seems too long. Also, eliminate unnecessary phrases like “in order to” and extra articles like “the” when they don’t add clarity.

## Clear error messages

When something goes wrong, it's important for us to be clear about what happened, why it happened, and what the next steps to take may be. Vague messages frustrate users and can even block them from completing their task.

When writing an error message, leave out extraneous words like "sorry" and "please." This makes errors easier to read and understand.

## Objective focused

When users engage with our product, they’re focused on getting tasks done, thinking first in terms of the problem they’re trying to solve, and then how to solve it.
Objective-focused content that starts with the task first and then offers the solution can make it easier for users to quickly find and understand the information they need.

## Verb tenses

### Recent past (instant feedback)

For a status update on something that has just happened in response to a user action or when a user is otherwise watching for an update, use the **present perfect** tense. This is ideal for toast messages and terminal output.

There are two options:

- When brevity is the priority, use only the noun and verb (omitting articles and prepositions); for example, “Pipeline scheduled.”
- When you want to use a full phrase for a human feel, use a complete sentence; for example, “The pipeline has been scheduled.”

### Distant past (earlier than instant feedback)

Use **past tense**.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| The pipeline was last run on October 3. | The pipeline has been run on October 3. |

### State

Use **present tense**.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| The pipeline is scheduled to run on October 3. | The pipeline will be run on October 3. |

### Instructions

Use the **present tense** with an imperative form (also known as a command).
