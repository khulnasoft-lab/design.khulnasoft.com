For clear and consistent communication, it’s important to always use correct terminology.

You can find most terms in the [word list](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/word_list.html) that's maintained by the Technical Writing team. If you do not see the term you need, open a merge request to add it, or contact a technical writer for assistance.

In addition:

- Search the product for the term before creating a new term.
- Be extremely cautious when using [jargon](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-jargon.html) and [colloquialisms](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/writing-with-slang). They can confuse new users and cause problems with internationalization.
- Consider [screen readers](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/08/advice-for-creating-content-that-works-well-with-screen-readers/) and their ability to interpret non-standard terminology.

Use the following guidance in addition to the guidance in the word list.

## Verbs & adjectives

When using verbs or adjectives:

If the context clearly refers to the object, use them alone.
- **Example:** `Edit` or `Closed`

If the context isn’t clear enough, use them with the object.
- **Example:** `Edit issue` or `Closed issues`
