description: Dates and times clarify when an event occurred. The way they are formatted should be informative, not disruptive. While users can choose a preferred date and time format, there are occasions when we default to a specified format instead.

## Date and time options

### Absolute format

The absolute format clarifies the precise date and time that something occurred.

Absolute date and time information can be [localized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) to display a user's local date and time or follow the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format. See the [Guidelines](#Guidelines) section for more information about when dates should be localized, and when they should be shown in ISO 8601.
  - Localized datel localized dates display should always display with date, month, year, and the year should be full, as `Jan 03, 2022`, it can be shortened to `Jan 03` when space is tight. Always show the full date and time data along with the timezone in a tooltip if the date is shortened such as,  `Jan 03, 2022, GMT-8`.
   * For year, we are using `numeric, ex: 2022`(default) or `2-digit, ex: 02`(when there is an limited space). 
   * For month, we always use `short, ex: Mar`(the API will auto-adjust to full if the language can't be shortened, such as Chinese).
   * For date, we are `2-digit, ex: 01`. 
   * For time zone, we are using `shortOffset, ex: GMT-8`(default) or `long, ex: Pacific Standard Time`(when it is needed in the context). 
  - ISO 8601 format is displayed `YYYY-MM-DD`. Time can also be appended to the end of the date if necessary as `HH:MM:SS`

### Relative format

The relative format communicates the approximate amount of time that has passed since an event occurred; whether that event occurred XX minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s), month(s), or year(s) ago. For example, it is used to communicate that an issue was opened `1 minute ago` or `10 months ago`.

When using the relative format, always display the absolute time in a tooltip following the [Guidelines](#guidelines) below.

## Guidelines

### Which format to use when

- Display date and time information in the absolute format unless [users specify they want to use relative formatting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#use-relative-times) instead.
- If it's possible to detect the browser settings, display the localized time, for example `Jan 03, 2021`. Otherwise, fall back to displaying the date in ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD` (time is optionally appended after the date, `HH:MM:SS`).

### Exceptions

In certain scenarios, the date and time are displayed in a specific format and the user's preference is overridden.

Use [absolute format](#absolute-format) when:
- Users need specific dates and/or times for technical, security, or legal reasons. For example, in an audit log, a tax form, or a security alert.
- Users would need to convert relative time to absolute time in order to complete a task.
- A range of time is displayed, for example in a date picker.

Use [relative format](#relative-format) when:
- Content is updated frequently and specifics are not critical. For example, a live newsfeed or notification.

### Adding timezone data

In situations where timezone context is important, for example in alerts or incidents, append the timezone information to the end of the date and time.
