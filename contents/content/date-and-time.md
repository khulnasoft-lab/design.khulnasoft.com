description: Dates and times clarify when an event occurred. The way they are formatted should be informative, not disruptive. While users can choose a preferred date and time format, there are occasions when we default to a specified format instead.

## Date and time options

### Absolute format

The absolute format clarifies the precise date and time that something occurred.

Absolute date and time information can be [localized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) to display a user's local date and time or follow the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format. See the [Guidelines](#Guidelines) section for more information about when dates should be localized, and when they should be shown in ISO 8601.
  - Localized dates display the day, month, and full year by default (for example: Jan 03, 2022). The date can be shortened to the day and month when space is tight (Jan 03). If the date is shortened, always show the full date and time data in a tooltip, along with the timezone (Jan 03, 2022, GMT-8).
   * We use the `numeric` value of the `year` parameter to display the year in full (for example: 2022). The `2-digit` value can be used instead if there is limited space which displays the shortened version of the year (22).
   * For the `month` parameter, we always use the `short` value (for example: Mar). Note that the API will auto-adjust to `full` if the language can't be shortened.
   * For the `day` parameter, we use the `2-digit` value. (For example: 01)
   * For `timeZoneName`, we use either `shortOffset` (for example: GMT-8) or `long` (for example: Pacific Standard Time), depending on what is needed to make the time zone clear in context. 
  - ISO 8601 format is displayed (for example: YYYY-MM-DD). Time can also be appended to the end of the date if necessary as (HH:MM:SS).

### Relative format

The relative format communicates the approximate amount of time that has passed since an event occurred; whether that event occurred XX minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s), month(s), or year(s) ago. For example, it is used to communicate that an issue was opened `1 minute ago` or `10 months ago`.

When using the relative format, always display the absolute time in a tooltip following the [Guidelines](#guidelines) below.

## Guidelines

### Which format to use when

- Display date and time information in the absolute format unless [users specify they want to use relative formatting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#use-relative-times) instead.
- If it's possible to detect the browser settings, display the localized time, for example `Jan 03, 2021`. Otherwise, fall back to displaying the date in ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD` (time is optionally appended after the date, `HH:MM:SS`).

### Exceptions

In certain scenarios, the date and time are displayed in a specific format and the user's preference is overridden.

Use [absolute format](#absolute-format) when:
- Users need specific dates and/or times for technical, security, or legal reasons. For example, in an audit log, a tax form, or a security alert.
- Users would need to convert relative time to absolute time in order to complete a task.
- A range of time is displayed, for example in a date picker.

Use [relative format](#relative-format) when:
- Content is updated frequently and specifics are not critical. For example, a live newsfeed or notification.

### Adding timezone data

In situations where timezone context is important, for example in alerts or incidents, append the timezone information to the end of the date and time.
