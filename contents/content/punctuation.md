## Case

Use sentence case for titles, headings, labels, menu items, and buttons. Use title case when referring to [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) or [products](https://about.gitlab.com/products/). Note that some features are also objects (e.g. “Merge Requests” and “Merge requests”).

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Add issues to the Issue Board feature in GitLab Hosted. | Add Issues to the Issue Board Feature in GitLab Hosted. |

Always capitalize the first word in bulleted lists. This includes sentences that complete an introductory stem.

<table class="do-dont m-b-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This sentence completes the introductory stem, it is capitalized.</li>
          <li>This sentence also completes the introductory stem, it is capitalized.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>this sentence completes the introductory stem, it should be  capitalized.</li>
          <li>this sentence also completes the introductory stem, it also should be capitalized.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Periods

The period signals to a speaker or reader that the sentence has come to an end. They assist users in visually breaking up content and should be used appropriately. Follow these guidelines:

Place periods after a link if it‘s followed by a sentence.

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Mention someone to notify them. [More information](#). This is another sentence. | Mention someone to notify them. [More information](#). |

Place periods after sentences that follow a link.

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Mention someone to notify them. [More information.](#)This is another sentence. | Mention someone to notify them [More information.](#) This is another sentence |

Use a period after every bullet point that is a sentence.

<table class="do-dont m-b-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a complete sentence.</li>
          <li>This is also a complete sentence.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a complete sentence, it needs a period</li>
          <li>This is also a complete sentence, it also needs a period</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use a period after every bullet point that completes the introductory stem.

<table class="do-dont m-b-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This sentence completes the introductory stem.</li>
          <li>This sentence completes the introductory stem.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This sentence completes the introductory stem</li>
          <li>This sentence completes the introductory stem</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use no punctuation after bullets that are not sentences and do not complete the stem.

<table class="do-dont m-b-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>These are just words in a list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One item</li>
          <li>Two item</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>These are just words in a list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One item.</li>
          <li>Two item.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use all sentences or all fragments in a bulleted list, not a mixture.

<table class="do-dont m-b-6">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistency is key here.</li>
          <li>Don't mix sentences and individual items in a list.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistency is key here.</li>
          <li>Item</li>
          <li>Don't mix sentences and individual items in a list.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Contractions

We encourage the use of contractions to make writing simpler and easier to read. However, don’t make a sentence harder to understand just to follow this rule. For example, “do not” can give more emphasis than “don’t” when needed.

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| it’s, can’t, wouldn’t, you’re, you’ve, haven’t, don’t | it is, cannot, would not, it’ll, should’ve |

## Numbers

Use “1, 2, 3” instead of “one, two, three” for numbers. One exception is when mixing uses of numbers, such as “Enter two 3s.”

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| 3 new commits | Three new commits |
| Enter two 3s. | Enter 2 3s. |

## Punctuation

Use punctuation to add clarity or be grammatically correct.
