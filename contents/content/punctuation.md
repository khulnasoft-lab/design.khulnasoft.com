## Periods

A period signals to a speaker or reader that a sentence has come to an end, and it assists users in visually breaking up content.

- Do **not** use periods:
  - For the label of a UI element. For example, for the label associated with a checkbox, text box, or button.
  - For the title of a UI element. For example, for the title of a banner, warning, broadcast message, dialog box, or modal.
- Use periods:
  - For additional help text. For example, for text in banners, warnings, and for the extra description below a checkbox or text box.

Follow these additional guidelines:

Use periods with links that are full sentences.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| Mention someone to notify them. [Learn more](#). This is another sentence. | Mention someone to notify them. [More](#). |

Use a period after every bullet point that is a sentence.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don’t</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a complete sentence.</li>
          <li>This is also a complete sentence.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a complete sentence, it needs a period</li>
          <li>This is also a complete sentence, it also needs a period</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use a period after every bullet point that completes the introductory stem.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don’t</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completed by this sentence.</li>
          <li>Also completed by this sentence.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This is an introductory stem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Completed by this sentence</li>
          <li>Also completed by this sentence</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use no punctuation after bullets that are not sentences and do not complete the stem.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don’t</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>These are just words in a list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One item</li>
          <li>Two item</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>These are just words in a list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One item.</li>
          <li>Two item.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Use all sentences or all fragments in a bulleted list, not a mixture.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Do</th>
      <th>Don’t</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistency is key here.</li>
          <li>Item.</li>
          <li>Don’t mix sentences and individual items in a list.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistency is key here.</li>
          <li>Item</li>
          <li>Don’t mix sentences and individual items in a list.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Contractions

We encourage the use of contractions to make writing simpler and easier to read. However, don’t make a sentence harder to understand just to follow this rule. For example, “do not” can give more emphasis than “don’t,” when needed.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| it’s, can’t, wouldn’t, you’re, you’ve, haven’t, don’t | it is, cannot, would not, it’ll, should’ve |

## Numbers

Use “1, 2, 3” instead of “one, two, three” for numbers. One exception is when mixing uses of numbers, such as “Enter two 3s.”

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| 3 new commits | Three new commits |
| Enter two 3s. | Enter 2 3s. |
