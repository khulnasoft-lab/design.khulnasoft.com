As with the overall brand, GitLab motion guidelines follow a sleek, clean aesthetic that allows video producers to convey the platform’s ease of use and highlights messaging without cluttering the frame. These motion guidelines set the standard for any video that involves motion graphics to any degree.

## Animation styles

### Illustrations

Video producers can create large-scale, custom illustrations as part of a given video concept. These illustrations should adhere to brand guidelines and match the style of the [illustrations](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-design/marketing-illustrations) previously mentioned. 

Illustrations are assembled from multiple layers revealed in sequence. Each layer can have its own unique motion type which combines to create harmony. Strokes and lines are animated independently with a stroke reveal effect.

#### Illustration easing

Both interactive and expressive motion come with unique parameters to create scalable consistency in their use.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Illustration easing example</figcaption>
</figure>


### Iconography

Iconography is used to convey concrete concepts, features, and benefits. We use motion with iconography to make them feel purposeful.

The design of the icons dictates its reveal. Motion should be swift at .65 seconds. We maintain purposeful motion by embracing the design elements which formulate a short visual narrative.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Iconography animation example</figcaption>
</figure>

## Dot animations

Dot animations help to convey abstract concepts that an icon or illustration alone can’t express. Dots are purposeful in their movement. They can also be paired with on-screen copy to enforce an idea. Quick moments of secondary motion and a slow drift are used to keep visual interest. Animation speed is variable and can change based on video length, music, and voice over.

Voice over example: “No more stitching point solutions. All you need is GitLab.”

## Frame composition

In general, frame compositions should follow brand guidelines: maintain a large amount of negative space and do not clutter the frame with excessive elements or text.

Frame is split into rows and columns. Points of interest like text, icons, or footage can appear and move between sections. This will allow for more negative space between the assets. Avoid diagonal movement.

**Motion sample:** The text above is in section 1-2 while iconography occupies space in sections 2-2 and 2-3.

## Tanuki + DevOps loop

Whenever introducing the GitLab logo in video, the trace logo animation may be used. It should animate on using a stroke reveal using Interactive Ease. The file for this animation can be found [here](url.com).

Do not use any other reveals such as fading on logo, having the logo move in from outside the frame, or scaling to reveal the logo.

## Gradients

### Gradient option 1

For creating the gradient, use the Adobe Illustrator free-form gradient tool found in the gradient panel. Apply the gradient using points. Use between 3-5 colors. To achieve softer colors, use the HSB palette and drop saturation of any brand color between 1-50%. The gradient sections can also be cropped to achieve a softer look.

If the tanuki is placed on the background, it should be within the white area for legibility. Gradient can also be used inside text and linework of icons.

</figure>

### Gradient option 2

Use 3-5 colors to create an organic gradient with overlapping blurred shape layers (pink, purple, and orange). Blur at 71% with 3 iterations. Animate turbulent displacement evolution to create subtle animation.

  <img class="figure-img gl-p-5" src="/img/brand/gradient-2.png" alt="Gradient example" role="img" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Gradient example</figcaption>
</figure>

### Gradient with text

To emphasize certain words or phrases, you can fill text with the gradient. This can be used on keywords, whole phrases and text repetitions. The text is used to mask out the gradient. 

<figure class="figure" role="figure" aria-label="Gradient type example">
  <img class="figure-img gl-p-5" src="/img/brand/gradient-type.png" alt="Gradient type example" role="img" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Gradient type example</figcaption>
</figure>

### Incorrect usage

Be careful not to go too heavy with one particular color. Do not overuse motion with gradients; keep movement subtle.

## Typographic animations

### Snap edits

To elicit excitement and draw attention to specific words, use quick snap edits in typographic animations. These should be used in lieu of any large-scale drifts, move ins, zooms, etc.

### Motion and scaling

When a more subdued treatment is required, use **subtle drifts** to maintain movement and avoid dead frames. Use this treatment for moments of pause when you want to let words sink in. Drifts utilize a 2-5% scale or position change. 

<figure class="figure" role="figure" aria-label="Drift tech specs">
  <img class="figure-img gl-p-5" src="/img/brand/drift-tech-specs.svg" alt="Drift tech specs" role="img" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Drift tech specs</figcaption>
</figure>

### Outline reveals

Use text oulines and fills to create drama when revealing words or to emphasize certain words. The text can be split into two parts: a fill and a stroke. Use the following steps:

1. Each word pops into place at 100% opacity, with  “innovation” popping in at 30% opacity
1. Each character of “innovation” is seperated with an individual stroke so each letter can animate uniquely. 
1.  stroke begins to animate as “innovation” moves to meet the other words.
1. Once in place the opacity moves from 30% to 100%.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Outline reveals example</figcaption>
</figure>

### Type repetitions

Type repetitions add visual interest while drawing attention to areas of emphasis. They are a more dynamic, spirited way to emphasize text. They can be used to emphasize a single word or a whole phrase and can animate in a variety of ways. 

Slide the text lines upward into position behind masks one line at a time, transitioning opacity from 0-100 using our interactive ease.

  <img class="figure-img gl-p-5" src="/img/brand/type-repetitions.svg" alt="Type repetitions" role="img" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Type repetitions</figcaption>
</figure>

## Transitions

### Partial DevOps loop transition

In addition to straight cuts, when moving from animation to footage, footage to animation, or footage to footage, use the DevOps loop transition.

**Note:** The tanuki should never be used as a transition mask. Use only the loop itself.

### Loop sections as mask

In the DevOps loop transition, the loop is split into sections. Those sections are then animated as masks to reveal another layer. DevOps loop transitions can be colorful and utilize solid colors as well as gradients. 

**Note:** The orange in the motion sample is only used to differentiate the sections.

## Lower thirds

Lower thirds are designed for simplicity and clarity. Simplified for contrast and legiblity. Lower thirds will typically be white, but charcoal can be used on light backgrounds. Avoid mixing colors and refer to brand [typography guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-design/typography) if needed.

- **Transition in:** Animate opacity from 0% to 100%. Transition duration is 1 second. 
- Lower third remains onscreen for 4-5 seconds. 
- **Transition out:** Animate opacity from 100% to 0%. Transition duration is 1 second.
