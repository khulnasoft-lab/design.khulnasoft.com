Diagrams are used to illustrate the functionality of the GitLab product. They act like a manual, representing complex ideas step-by-step. They should be structured and visually clear, while using as minimal detail as possible.

### Color

- Diagrams use plenty of negative space to make the story easy to follow and understand.
- Colors should be used to provide additional instruction and clarity; consider how some colors can carry a positive or negative connotation, how they can be used to group related elements, or how they can aid in the direction and flow of the diagram.

### Linework

- Diagrams are mostly constructed of linework and should match our guidelines regarding lines and stroke weight.
- Motion lines can be used as accents; they should help tell the story and/or guide the user’s eye through the diagram’s flow.
- Line breaks give the feel of openness throughout the diagram. Lines should break before touching an icon, unless the icon is contained within a circle.
- Dashed lines can be used to connect type and visual elements.

### Icons

- Marketing icons should be used and contained within a circle with 25% padding around the icon.

### Logo

- A single-color tanuki (refer to [logomark variations](/brand-logo/logomark#variations)) can be used sparingly in diagrams to denote a product feature.
- When representing how the GitLab product works in conjunction with or compared to another product, use the core logo.
