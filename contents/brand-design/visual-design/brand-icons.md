Icons are quickly identifiable graphics that represent common items in a redacted way. Our marketing icons are the building blocks of our illustration style, but they can also be used as individual units. They should be straightforward and simplistic, visualizing a single topic or call to action. They take a secondary role to the copy and are used at smaller scale; anything larger should default to an illustration and anything intended for functional use within the product should use the [Product icon set](/product-foundations/iconography) instead.

### Construction

The marketing icons are created using the 8px grid system found within this [template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-FdsDeYcx_yPBMI9cjWclWAz_TPYqFU/view?usp=sharing). The icon set exists in two scales: 24px for smaller assets and 96px for larger assets. They are stylized in the following ways:

- Our icon set consists entirely of linework, using a stroke weight of 1px or 2px, respectively. 
- In general, default to either white or charcoal linework for contrast purposes. 
- The icons should contain one rounded corner, if possible within the shape, with a radius of 3px or 12px, respectively. 
- Our icons arenâ€™t fully enclosed; we create an open feeling by incorporating line breaks throughout, which also speaks to our iterative processes.

### Software development lifecycle

This specific set of icons represents each stage of our software development lifecycle at each stage of the process. They are designed to be presented as a set when referring to the entire journey of the lifecycle or individually when referring to a specific stage.
