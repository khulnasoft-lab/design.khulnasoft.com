name: Marketing icons

[Marketing icons](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design/_resources/_designer-resources/assets/icon-library/marketing-icons) are the building blocks of our illustration style and are used as singular units. They should be straightforward, only visualizing a single topic or call to action. Icons are quickly identifiable, representing common items in a redacted way. They take a secondary role to the copy and are used at small scales ranging from 24px - 216px; anything larger should default to an illustration and anything intended for functional use within the product should use the [Product icon set](/product-foundations/iconography) instead.

### Construction

The marketing icons are created using the 8px grid system found within this [template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-FdsDeYcx_yPBMI9cjWclWAz_TPYqFU/view?usp=sharing). They consist entirely of linework, using a weight of 2px (1px for icons smaller than 64px) and Charcoal color. Alternatively, white is used if the icon is placed on a dark background. The icons should contain one rounded corner, if possible with the shape, with a radius of 12px (3px for icons smaller than 64px).

### Software development lifecycle

[This specific set of icons](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design/_resources/_designer-resources/assets/icon-library/software-development-lifecycle-icons) represents each stage of our software development lifecycle at each stage of the process. They are designed to be presented as a set when referring to the entire journey of the lifecycle or individually when referring to a specific stage.
