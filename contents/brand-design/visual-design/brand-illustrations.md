Illustrations are a form of brand storytelling, adding clarity and context to complex ideas. Illustrations elevate the messaging, so they are typically accompanied by copy; the two together are necessary and should balance and complement one another. 

Our marketing illustrations are an extension of our custom iconography system, and they reinforce our brand personality, company values, and product in the following ways:

- **Speed and movement** are conveyed through lines and gradients. By creating motion in our static work, we show efficiency and a sense of forward momentum.
- **Linework** is inspired by lines of code, which grounds the illustration in our product.
- **UI-centric iconography** is incorporated throughout an illustration.
- **Dashed lines** speak to our iterative processes.
- **Combining elements** shows collaboration and how multiple systems are working alongside one another.
- **Inviting elements**, such as color and diversity, add vibrancy and life to the story.

### Construction

When building illustrations, adhere to the following guidelines to maintain visual consistency:

1. **Linework** creates the overall foundation of an illustration.
   1. A single stroke weight should be used consistently throughout any asset. 
   1. Discretion should be used to ensure that lines appear thin; in general, lines can be set to 2px for digital assets and 15px for large print assets (such as event booths).
1. **Solid shapes** add weight to the illustration and fill out the form laid out from the linework of the piece.
   1. A single shape can also be used as a background element to ground the visual. In this case, the illustration should break out of the container shape.
   1. Solid shapes can be added to icons to create contrast.
   1. Solid shapes can also be used as background elements to add texture or fill out negative space.
1. **Detail** should be purposeful by providing additional context to the overall story.
   1. Additional lines, shapes, and gradients can be incorporated to depict motion and direction.
1. **Corners** use a mix of angles and curves to create a dynamic visual.
   1. Generally, a curved corner radius should be 25-30% of the width of the square.
   1. For shapes with a curve applied to all corners, the radius should be 5-10%.
1. **Color** should be used intentionally to communicate different aspects and features; use colors that resonate with our product to pull the story of the illustration forward.

## Marketing diagrams

[Diagrams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design/_resources/_designer-resources/assets/diagrams) are used to illustrate the functionality of the GitLab product. They act like a manual, representing complex ideas step-by-step. They should be structured and visually clear, while using as minimal detail as possible.

### Color

- Diagrams use plenty of white space to make the story easy to follow and understand.
- Orange 03p or Teal 02s can be used sparingly on icons to denote a positive or negative association. **Example:** Orange 03p for an X, or Teal 02s for a check mark.
- With white backgrounds, use Charcoal for the linework and type.
  - Gray 03 can be used for dashed lines and motion lines
  - Purple 01s can be used to add depth to elements or as an extra layer of color in the background.
- With Charcoal backgrounds, use white for the linework and type.
  - Gray 03 can be used for dashed lines and motion lines.
  - Purple 01s can be used in parts of the linework to highlight and/or direct the user’s eye through the flow of the diagram.
  - Gray 05 can be used to add depth to elements or used as an extra layer of color in the background.

### Linework

- Motion lines are used as accents; they should help tell the story and/or guide the user’s eye through the diagram’s flow.
- Line breaks give the feel of openness throughout the diagram. Lines should break before touching an icon, unless the icon is contained within a circle.
- Dashed lines are used to connect type and visual elements.

### Marketing icons

- Lines should break before touching an icon, unless the icon is contained within a circle.
- When using an icon within a circle, ensure the icon has 25% padding around it.

### Logo

- A single-color tanuki (either Charcoal or Orange 02p) can be used sparingly in diagrams to denote a product feature.
- When representing how the GitLab product works in conjunction with or compared to another product, use the core logo.
