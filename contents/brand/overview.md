These guidelines set the standard for upholding a cohesive brand image. Our brand, like our product and company, has arrived to where it is today through the collaboration of numerous contributors and iterative processes. It exists as the creative expression of our company mission, vision, and [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/).

At GitLab, we’ve created an environment where everyone can contribute, even when it comes to our brand. In 2015, the brand first emerged through the collaborative efforts of the wider GitLab community. After our company went public in 2021, we took a closer look at all its components and began a larger iteration to align our image with the next chapter of our journey. With this creative refresh, we put the product at the center of our brand and refined each element to work seamlessly together.

Our product propels users into the future of DevSecOps. With that purpose in mind, we’ve designed our brand to embody the efficiency, innovation, modern-edge, and simplicity of our single application DevSecOps Platform.

## Brand voice and identity

GitLab’s brand voice represents and expresses who we are as a brand. It is a core part of our brand identity, informed by our brand values. Our brand voice should come through clearly and consistently in all of our designs and communications.

Maintaining a consistent brand voice helps us:

    - Increase awareness, recognition, and trust in our brand
    - Communicate our unique value
    - Differentiate from our competitors
    - Express our personality

Our brand voice comprises the following personality traits:

1. Visionary

We are confident, sophisticated technical experts and category creators. We are committed to enabling and empowering our customers and community. We embrace new challenges, energizing our customers to navigate their own journeys with confidence. We lead by example through continuous innovation and a bias for action. We believe we are most successful when everyone can contribute.

    Example: We created the category.

2. Empathetic

We are thoughtful, collaborative, and considerate, as well as approachable and inclusive on a global scale. We are dedicated to understanding and supporting the diverse needs of our team and customers and crafting solutions to help them succeed.

    Example: The GitLab Community; our mission enabling everyone to contribute

3. Intentional

We are purposeful, direct, and transparent. We communicate with clarity and focus to create a reliable experience for our customers.

    Example: Our monthly release post
