name: Brand voice

Our voice embodies our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) and [mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission). We openly welcome others into our collaborative space, sharing an inclusive perspective on GitLabâ€™s vision.

Our brand principles extend to our voice and [communications](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines) as well. Consider how each characteristic works together to create a holistic narrative. For instance, our human-centric approach balances our ambitious edge; our concise messaging reinforces our trustworthiness; and so on. All facets are needed to fully represent who we are. Depending on the audience, it may make sense to lean into one area more than another.
