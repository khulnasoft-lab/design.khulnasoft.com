name: Using design tokens
---

A design token is a portable design decision that can be used in design and code.

## In design

<note>We are currently piloting using design tokens in Figma. We're asking that only those part of the pilot use the library. Learn more in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1771). More details about officially using design tokens will be coming soon, but in the meantime carry on with your typical design process.</note>

Design tokens are used by [applying Figma variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15343107263511-Apply-variables-to-designs) to elements on the canvas.

We've scoped these Figma variables by limiting the properties they can be applied to. This helps cut out the guess work when designing and supports recommended usage. For example, `text.color.default` can only be applied as a fill to a text element and not to a stroke or shape layer.

## In code

<note>A pilot for design tokens in code has been completed as part of this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1776), and we're currently doing more exploration with a small subset of components as part of this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/2583). More details about officially using design tokens will be coming soon, but in the meantime carry on with your typical development process.</note>
