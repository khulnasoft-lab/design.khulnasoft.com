One of our design goals is to convey GitLab’s distinct personality through illustration that is aesthetically refined, visually consistent, and reflective of our particular sense of style.

## Principles

1. **Be simple.** For clarity, we use simple and specific elements to create our illustrations. We take a "less is more" approach where illustrations are supportive. They should be obvious but not comprehensive, focusing on impression over complexity.
1. **Be optimistic.** We take an open-minded, positive, and friendly approach. Those values are reflected in our illustrations with a light and airy feel.
1. **Be helpful.** Our illustrations help users to understand concepts and guide them in the right direction.

## Efficiency and reuse

Practically, applying the principles gives us more leverage to think of the relationship of illustration to use case as a one-to-many instead of one-to-one. In other words, a single illustration could be used in multiple instances.

For example, a single empty state illustration could be abstracted enough to be used in multiple empty state pages where the visual _impression_ is supported more fully by the content and context. The illustration doesn't have to do all the heavy lifting.

To better support reuse, the [illustration library](https://www.figma.com/file/1ui9w228X0S5WxaD0SRdIA/Illustration-library?node-id=0%3A1) in Figma also contains dozens of small illustration components that represent concepts found throughout the product. These small illustrations can be used on their own, or as part of a larger illustration.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">An element and components combine as part of a larger illustration.</figcaption>
</figure>

By combining a multipurpose mindset with reusable components, the time it takes to create a new illustration, and the resulting number of illustrations, should both be reduced. This is a win both for designers, and users where time and consistency matters.

## Style

The illustration style is a derivative of the [GitLab Brand Standards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/brand-activation/brand-standards/#brand-resources), and is designed to work both in light and dark UI.

### Fill

A solid fill gives an element visual weight, emphasis, and dimension.

- Three steps for each hue provides a base (default) along with a highlight and shadow so that individual objects can have dimension and separate objects of the same hue can come forward or recede by comparison to each other.
- Transparency is used for fills, containers, and backgrounds where the object recedes in both light/dark UI. The transparency allows it to blend with the background so the effect is similar regardless of theme.

</div>

### Stroke

A stroke encapsulates an element, whether filled or not, and is used for line work.

- The default stroke is **4px**, but **2px** can be used for the occasional detail.
- Similar to a transparent fill, a transparent stroke blends with the background so receding effect is similar regardless of theme.
- A dashed stroke makes connections and infers empty or unpopulated elements.
- A line uses rounded caps, unless doing so would misrepresent the object.
- Round line joins are optional and also depend on the object.
- Align the stroke to the center or inside of the shape.

</div>

### Shape

An illustration is primarily comprised of geometric shapes. Use circles, rectangles, squares, and triangles for base elements, with lines and organic shapes for details as needed.

### Border radius

- Use a multiple of **2px** to keep values even when scaling up or down between grid sizes.
- Use minimal or no border radius to represent sharp corners, and anywhere between **4px** to **12px** for softer, rounded objects.

### Content

- An object should represent its most modern and recognizable form. For example, use a mobile phone instead of a rotary phone.
- Typography should be avoided in illustration because it isn't accessible for all users and can't be translated. It is acceptable to include 1–2 characters to represent text or language in general. For example, a character on a keyboard.
- The tanuki should only be used for marketing illustration and assets that directly represent GitLab in the product, like a GitLab bot avatar.

### Grid and size

Using predefined grids and sizes not only helps illustrations feel more consistent and intentional throughout the product, they also add helpful and meaningful constraints to reduce the time it takes to create an illustration.

An illustration can use either a large [isometric grid](#isometric-grid), or one of the three [focal point grid](#focal-point-grid) sizes to align with the use case.

#### Isometric grid

An isometric grid provides depth to concepts which can convey process, relationship, and parts. An isometric illustration isn't necessarily more complex, it's just leveraging dimension as an added attribute.

- **Large** (only): **288px × 288px** frame size. Used for feature promotion.
- An isometric grid uses guides that are rotated **30º** from the horizontal plane.
- Three subgrids are available to handle different angles: ramp left, ramp right, and ramp forward.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Isometric illustration example</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Focal point grid

A focal point grid leverages the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) to place elements with dedicated focal points. The vertical and horizontal guides divide the frame into nine equal parts. When multiple objects are present, placing them at or near the point of intersection can provide balance and movement.

Not all illustrations will have multiple objects or objects that need to align to an intersection point. Circular grid lines are also provided for centering within the frame.

- **Large**: **288px × 288px** frame size. Used for feature promotion.
- **Medium**: **144px × 144px** frame size. Used for empty states, error states, and banners.
- **Small** ("spot" illustration): **72px × 72px** frame size. Used when space is limited.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Focal point grid example</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Size

While an illustration will always be created using one of the grid sizes above, the final output dimensions follow these rules:

- Small illustrations are always output at **72px × 72px**, even if that means there's extra white space in the frame. This helps ensure that when multiple small illustrations are present in the same context they will optically align. [Icons](/product-foundations/iconography) follow a similar approach.
- Medium and large illustrations artwork must fill either the width, height, or both and the remaining whitespace be removed before exporting (frame cropped to artwork). Since only one illustration at these sizes should be present in a given context, this should create no alignment issues. Use [GitLab UI utility classes](https://unpkg.com/browse/@gitlab/ui@32.45.0/src/scss/utilities.scss) if additional space is needed in a page layout.
