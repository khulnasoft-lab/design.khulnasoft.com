name: Feedback animation

Feedback animation is used to confirm a user interaction with an interactive element.

## Guidelines

### When to use

1. State change transitions for interactive elements, such as hover, focus, and active.
1. To confirm a user interaction, including positive or negative feedback.

### Behavior

#### State change transitions

Interactive elements typically have four states: rest, hover, focus, and active. A component's appearance often changes between states as a response to interaction.

When the appearance changes, animate the transition between states using the following combinations.

| State | Example | Duration | Easing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hover` | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Button animation on hover: background and border colors are changing with ease easing" width="200"><source src="/video/feedback-hover.mp4"></video> | `200m` | `$gl-easing-out-cubic` |
| `focus` | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Button animation on focus: outline ring appears with easeOutCubic easing" width="200"><source src="/video/feedback-focus.mp4"></video> | `200ms` | `$gl-easing-out-cubic` |
| `active` | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Button animation on click: water rings surround the button" width="200"><source src="/video/feedback-active.mp4"></video> | `500ms` | `$gl-easing-out-cubic` |

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing recommended input focus ring animation." width="300"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-duration-do.mp4"></video><br />Minic the animation timing of real-world objects. Focus ring animates in 200ms. | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing instant input focus ring animation." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-duration-dont-1.mp4"></video><video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing slow input focus ring animation." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-duration-dont-2.mp4"></video><br />Avoid both instant and slow animations. The instant animation in the first example makes the interface feel less lively. The slow animation in the second example makes the interface feel sluggish. |
| <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing recommended input focus ring animation." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-easing-do.mp4"></video><br />Use cubic-bezier easing for focus feedback to make the animation appear more natural. The input focus ring accelerates quickly and slows as it stops. | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing a linear input focus ring animation." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-easing-dont-1.mp4"></video><video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Animating the text field focus ring with default ease function" width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-transition-easing-dont-2.mp4"></video><br />Avoid using linear or other default easing functions for focus feedback animations. The first example uses linear easing for the focus ring. The second example uses default easing. These transitions make the focus ring feel less lively. |

Keep animation predictable and consistent for elements in close proximity. Animate the same properties for close elements where possible. Reducing inconsistency will make an interaction more predictable and reduce the cognitive load for a user.

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing consistent hover styles of badge and two types of button." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-group-transition-do.mp4"></video><br />Animate the same properties for all elements in close proximity. Here the the border width, border visibility, and background color are changed for all elements. | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Video showing inconsistent hover styles of badge and two types of button." width="250"><source src="/video/feedback-group-transition-dont.mp4"></video><br />Animate different properties for each element. Here elements animate border width, border visibility, and background changes differently, or not at all. |

#### List components state change

Components like navigation, tables, or those that contain a list of options have many interactive elements in close proximity. To prevent perceptions of slow performance, feedback should be fast.

| State | Example | Duration | Easing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hover` | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Select option list animation on hover: background and border colors are changing with ease easing" width="200"><source src="/video/feedback-list-hover.mp4"></video> | `100m` | `$gl-easing-out-cubic` |
| `focus` | <video tabindex="0" preload="true" controls="" loop="true" playsinline="true" aria-label="Select option list animation on focus: outline ring appears with easeOutCubic easing" width="200"><source src="/video/feedback-list-focus.mp4"></video> | `100ms` | `$gl-easing-out-cubic` |

#### Loading feedback

Set the button to the loading state following a user action, if the result of the action occurs on the same page without a reload.

<story-viewer component="base-button" title="Loading button" :args-loading="true"></story-viewer>

#### Positive and negative feedback

<todo>Add positive and negative feedback</todo>

### Accessibility

A component should change state instantly when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled unless it's essential for the workflow. Instantly changing state doesn't mean no anmation. It should be invisible for users, but visible for the browser. Because some JavaScript actions could use UI animation, so animation should last `0.01ms`.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    .element {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
        transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    }
}
```
