Welcome to the GitLab Brand Guidelines, the official resource outlining our brandâ€™s overall look and feel and its creative components.

The [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/) brand exists as the creative expression of our company [mission](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/), [vision](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/vision/), and [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/). At GitLab, everyone contributes to building and representing our brand. Consistently applying these guidelines across all of our work increases awareness, recognition, and trust. It also communicates our unique value, showcases our identity, and differentiates us from our competitors. A unified visual identity supports our goal for GitLab to be recognized as the most comprehensive AI-driven DevSecOps platform.
