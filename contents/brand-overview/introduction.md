The [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/) brand exists as the creative expression of our company [mission](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/), [vision](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/vision/), and [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/). Our brand guidelines are a comprehensive resource that outlines the brandâ€™s creative components.

At GitLab, everyone contributes to building and representing our brand. Consistently applying these guidelines across all of our work increases awareness, recognition, and trust. It also communicates our unique value, showcases our identity, and differentiates us from our competitors. A unified visual identity supports our goal for GitLab to be recognized as the most comprehensive AI-driven DevSecOps platform.

If you have questions about the brand guidelines, please reach out to the #brand team in Slack.
