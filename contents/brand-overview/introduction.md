Welcome to the GitLab Brand Guidelines, the official resource outlining our brandâ€™s overall look and feel and its creative components.

The [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/) brand exists as the creative expression of our company [mission](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/), [vision](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/vision/), and [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/). At GitLab, everyone contributes to building and representing our brand. Consistently applying these guidelines across all of our work increases awareness, recognition, and trust. It also communicates our unique value, showcases our identity, and differentiates us from our competitors. A unified visual identity supports our goal for GitLab to be recognized as the most comprehensive AI-driven DevSecOps platform.

#### Who are the guidelines for?

The guidelines serve as the starting point for anyone who is interested in working with our brand. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with our design system if you are a:

## Brand personality

We have three key personality traits that bring our brand to life. We are **visionary**, **empathetic**, and **intentional**; these characteristics come to life in both our messaging and designs to tell the greater story of who we are as a company.

### 1. Visionary

We are confident, sophisticated technical experts and category creators. We are committed to enabling and empowering our customers and community. We embrace new challenges, energizing our customers to navigate their own journeys with confidence. We lead by example through continuous innovation and a bias for action. We believe we are most successful when everyone can contribute.

*Example: We created the category.*

### 2. Empathetic

We are thoughtful, collaborative, and considerate, as well as approachable and inclusive on a global scale. We are dedicated to understanding and supporting the diverse needs of our team and customers and crafting solutions to help them succeed.

*Example: The GitLab Community; our mission enabling everyone to contribute*

### 3. Intentional

We are purposeful, direct, and transparent. We communicate with clarity and focus to create a reliable experience for our customers.

*Example: Our monthly release post*
