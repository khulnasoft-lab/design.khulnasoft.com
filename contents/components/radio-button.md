A radio button typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Each radio button is boolean and only one can be selected at a time.

## Usage

- Use radio buttons to present a set of options, where only one option can be selected at a time.
- One radio button should be selected as the default choice by using the `checked` attribute.

Use the following table to see when radio buttons should be used over other alternative components.

### Legends, Labels, and Help text

- Radio button labels are set in regular font weight, positioned to the right of the element, and should be as short as possible.
- Use a `fieldset` with `legend` (set in bold font weight and positioned above the group of radio buttons) to group a set of radio buttons. Some screen readers will announce the contents of the legend before each nested input to maintain context for a user.
- [Help text](/components/forms#help-text) can be added below the radio button label or as a paragraph below the group.

### Visual Design

- Radio buttons use high-contrast colors for labels and default browser UI to indicate selected and unselected states.
- A vertical (stacked) layout is preferred, with one radio button per line. For sets of two with short labels where wrapping or width constraints are not an issue the inline (horizontal) layout is acceptable.
- Avoid mixing stacked and inline radio button groups within the same form or context.

### Interaction

- Users are able to select an option with click/tap on the radio button or its label.
- Selecting one option unselects all others.
