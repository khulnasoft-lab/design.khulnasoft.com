Buttons execute an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience. Different button categories help guide users through certain actions. Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it either by text, icon, or both. Additional meaning can be derived from the button style.

## Categories

Different button categories bring varying emphasis to potential user actions. This makes the page comprehensive while guiding the user through performing a task.

### Primary

Primary buttons are the single most important action that moves the task forward within a context and thus have the most emphasis placed upon them. There should only be one call to action in any given context. Primary buttons are recognized by their solid color, bold text labels, and must use one of the four elementary button styles: Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), or Danger (red).

Defining context depends on the hierarchy of information displayed on the screen, the motivated user flow, and the available tasks. As an example; Settings pages may have multiple equally important contexts, each requiring its own primary button to complete its task.

Please note that contexts may be temporary, such as a modal.

[[Example:new-button-primary]]

### Secondary

Secondary buttons represent supplementary actions that the user is motivated to take. The outlined styling places less emphasis on these buttons. Just like primary buttons, secondary buttons also require one of the four elementary button styles: Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (orange), or Danger (red).

[[Example:new-button-secondary]]

### Tertiary

A tertiary button is the default button category. Tertiary buttons still have an outlined styling but cannot have one of the four elementary button styles. They are typically used for less important actions that are not promoted to the user.

[[Example:new-button-tertiary]]

## States

Buttons change depending on the user's interaction or set behavior. This is to ensure they are accessible and feel responsive in both desktop and mobile environments. Additionally, disabled and read-only buttons have specific styling and interaction restrictions that inform the user of their meaning.

### Hover, Active, and Focus

Buttons change depending on the user's interaction with them. In hover, active, and focus states the buttons will have a thicker border and their background color will change. For the focus state, buttons will get an additional blue glow indicating that they are in focus.

[[Example:new-button-variants]]

### Disabled

Disabled buttons prevent the user from performing an action. They are there to let the user know a certain action would be possible if circumstances were different. All buttons regardless of style are styled the same way when in the disabled state. Additionally they will show the "not-allowed" cursor style when hovered upon and have a faded text color.

[[Example:new-button-disabled]]

## Variants

Buttons derive additional meaning from their presented style and help the user quickly presume any consequences that button may cause when clicked.

### Neutral

The neutral button style is used most often and is generally picked when using tertiary buttons. It features grayscale colors with a white background.

[[Example:new-button-tertiary]]

### Elementary

Our elementary button styles all convey a different meaning due to their respective styling. Their colors are aligned with our [four primary chromatic colors](/foundations/colors).

#### Info

Buttons that represent activation or informative processes. They are represented in a blue color.

[[Example:new-button-info]]

#### Success

Buttons that represent positive actions such as the creation or addition of items. They are represented in a green color.

[[Example:new-button-success]]

#### Warning

Buttons that represent actions where the user should be cautious such as overriding certain rulesets. These actions can be undone or somehow rectified by the user if a mistake is made. They are represented in an orange color.

Please note that often the secondary button category is the correct choice here as the user will mostly not be motivated to delete content when completing the task at hand.

[[Example:new-button-warning]]

#### Danger

Buttons that represent actions that are destructive, such as deleting content. These actions cannot be undone. They are represented in a red color.

Please note that often the secondary button category is the correct choice here as the user will mostly not be motivated to delete content when completing the task at hand.

[[Example:new-button-danger]]

### Dashed

Dashed button styles are used when something has not yet been created. Their action will lead the user to create the missing item, after which it will replace the dashed button with a link to the item.

[[Example:new-button-dashed]]

### Dark and Inverted

Some circumstances are exceptions in that they require a different button style than normal to still be accessible. When the UI is darker than normal, a dark or inverted button style may be required. These button styles are only possible for tertiary category buttons.

## Combinations

Buttons come in many different combinations to fit different situations. Some trigger a dropdown while others combine multiple similar actions together

### Text

The default variation is the text button. They contain a text label and have no special interactions.

[[Example:new-button-tertiary]]

### Icon

Icon buttons provide the user with visual iconography to signify what the button does. They only contain an icon label and have no special interactions. They can be used when a text button variation would be too big or the meaning of an icon conveys what will happen in a more concise way.

[[Example:new-button-icon]]

### Icon + text

Text button variations might be supplemented with an icon to both clarify an action and call attention to a button. Icons are always positioned to the left of the text label.

Please note to **not** use two icons in the same button.

[[Example:new-button-icon-and-text]]

### Emoji

Emoji buttons provide the user with visual to signify what the emotion users have attributed to the parent object. They only contain an emoji label and convert to an active state when pressed.

[[Example:new-button-emoji]]

### Dropdown

Dropbown buttons trigger menus of options which can be either actions or input values. 

See [dropdowns](/components/dropdowns) for more information.

#### Split dropdown

Dropdown buttons may be split when its options are actions. The text button will allow immediate access to the most common option and an attached dropdown button to either change the default action or directly access a list of related actions. The dropdown button is attached to the right of the text button and has a chevron icon as its label.

If the dropdown menu has no related actions available, a split dropdown button should be converted back to just a text button.

The currently selected action has a checkmark on the left side of the dropdown item. See also [checkmark dropdowns](/components/dropdowns).

See [dropdowns](/components/dropdowns) for more information.

#### Icon dropdown

Icon dropdown variations function similar to dropdown button variations with the difference being an icon label.

See [dropdowns](/components/dropdowns) for more information.

### Ellipsis

Ellipsis buttons allow for expanding content inline. It can be used when content is hidden for the purpose of not overloading the user or because of initial space constraints.

[[Example:new-button-ellipsis]]

### Group

Button groups merge frequently used buttons with a close relationship or similar actions together to aid with arrangement and spacing. Button groups are always displayed in a horizontal row.

### Icon group

Icon group variations function similar to button group variations with the difference being an icon label.

### Segmented control

A segmented control allows users to choose one out of a range of available options. It’s commonly used as an alternative to dropdowns and radio selections.

See [segmented control](/components/segmented-control) for more information.

### Icon segmented control

Icon segmented control variations function similar to segmented control button variations with the difference being an icon label. 

See [segmented control](/components/segmented-control) for more information.

### Pagination

Pagination is a specific example of a [segmented control](/components/pagination). It indicates the number of pages available, what page the user is on, and controls for navigating between pages. 

See [pagination](/components/pagination) for more information.

## Sizing

Depending on the interface buttons may either use the medium or small size.

### Medium

This is the default button size.

[[Example:new-button-medium]]

### Small

This is the alternative button size for use in tight spaces.

[[Example:new-button-small]]

### Full width

Buttons can be expanded to the full width of the parent container. This can be used for buttons embedded inside smaller width containers or to improve usability on mobile viewports.

[[Example:new-button-full-width]]

## Order

Buttons are ordered by importance from right to left. This means primary buttons are always on the right followed by secondary buttons etc. As an effect it means buttons with dismissive actions are on the left and buttons with affirmative actions are on the right. Depending on the context, the primary, affirmative action may be destructive.

## Positioning

Buttons are positioned towards the right and are placed next to each other when there are multiple. This applies to buttons with affirmative, dismissive, and destructive actions.

Please note to **not** place a button below another button if there is space to place them side by side.

## Labels

Button labels should be short and concise while conveying what happens when the button is clicked. Buttons use [sentence case](/content/punctuation) and a normal font weight. An icon can be used in place of text.

Please note to **not** mix text and icon label buttons together within the same interface.
