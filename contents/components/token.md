Tokens represent keywords and are used to add or filter objects. They allow users to input information, converting their text to tokens.

## Usage

A token is used in a search query in places where the user is expected to include multiple queries.

- Input tokens are used to add content. For example, these tokens are used when adding new users to a project. Multiple users can be added at once, and each inputted user is added as a token within the text field.
- Filter tokens are used to narrow down content and are attached to a qualifier. [Filters](/components/filters) inherit these tokens.

### When to use tokens

Use tokens to:

- Enable dynamic user input and verify that input by converting text into tokens.
- Allow users to manage filter and search options in a compact area.

### When not to use tables

Do not use tokens to:

- Recgonize which categories an object belongs to. Use [labels](https://design.gitlab.com/components/labels/) instead.
- Highlight more generic object metadata, like an issue’s status, a member’s role, or if a branch is protected. Use [badges](https://design.gitlab.com/components/badge/) instead.
- Display static action items persistently. Use [buttons](https://design.gitlab.com/components/buttons) instead.

### Placement

Tokens are can be positioned inline with the text cursor in a field, or in a stacked list. Tokens can wrap to a new row.

### Interaction

Interactive tokens include a [Remove](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~close) icon, positioned at the end of the token. When enabled, users can click the icon to remove the token from the set.

It is also possible to display view-only tokens, that don't include a Remove icon and cannot be removed from the set.
