Tokens represent keywords and are used to add or filter objects. They allow users to input information, converting their text to tokens.

## Usage

A token is used in a search query in places where the user is expected to include multiple queries.

- Input tokens are used to add content. For example, these tokens are used when adding new users to a project. Multiple users can be added at once, and each inputted user is added as a token within the text field.

- Filter tokens are used to narrow down content and are attached to a qualifier. [Filters](/components/filters) inherit these tokens.

### Placement

Tokens are can be positioned inline with the text cursor in a field, or in a stacked list. Tokens can wrap to a new row.

### Interaction

A token can include a Remove icon that comes with the functionality to remove the token from the set.

It is also possible to display view-only tokens, that cannot be removed from the set.
