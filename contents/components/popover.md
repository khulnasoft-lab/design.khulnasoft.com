## Guidelines

### When to use

- You don't want the user to lose context, but still want to provide additional useful unique information about referring elements.
- It isn't critical for the user to act upon the information.
- You want to give a user a summary of extended information and the option to learn more if needed.

### When not to use

- Consider if placing the content within a popover is needed at all. In many cases the most helpful, and [boring solution](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#boring-solutions), is to have the content inline and visible by default.
- If you're not providing rich markup or actionable items, consider using a [tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- If you're displaying critical content needed for users to complete a task, consider using a [modal](/components/modal).
- If you're displaying supplemental information to the user about an element or item, consider using a [drawer](/components/drawer).

### Appearance

- By default, a popover is placed above the referring element.
- When there isn't enough space in the viewport, the popover is moved to the side or below as needed.
- If a popover blocks related content, the placement can be manually set to avoid this.
- To optimize for readability, content within a popover uses left-alignment.
- Be mindful of the popover content that could overflow the viewport, and avoid a popover that flexes 100% of the container width.
- A popover has a default width of `280px`, but it can be adapted to have different sizes, depending on the content being wrapped.

### Behavior

- A popover is opened by clicking on an element that has the sole purpose of triggering it.
- When the popover is visible, the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus through any interactive elements within it.
- A popover can be dismissed by:
  - Clicking on the close button within it.
  - Clicking outside of it.
  - The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moving focus to another element.
  - The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key being pressed.

### Content

- A popover can contain interactive content such as a [link](/components/link) or [button](/components/button).
- A popover can contain rich content like an [avatar](/components/avatar).
- All copy within a popover should be short, actionable, and use clear language.
- The copy in the header should be shorter and even more concise than the copy in the body of the popover.

### Accessibility

When a popover is visible:

- The focus can move to the next logical interactive element in the DOM and doesn't loop in the popover.
- The content within is next in the reading order from the trigger element and not appended to the DOM.
