## Guidelines

### When to use

- You don‘t want to let the user lose context, but still want to provide additional useful unique information about referring elements.
- It isn’t critical for the user to act upon the information.
- You want to give a user a summary of extended information and the option to switch context if they want to dive in deeper.

### When not to use

- If you‘re not providing rich markup or actionable items, consider using a [tooltip](/components/tooltip).
- If you‘re displaying critical content needed for users to complete a task, consider using a [modal](/components/modal).
- If you‘re displaying supplemental information to the user about an element or item, consider using a [drawer](/components/drawer).

### Appearance

- By default, popovers are placed above the referring element. 
- When there isn’t enough space in the viewport, the popover is moved to the side or below as needed. 
- If a popover blocks related content, the placement can be manually set to avoid this.
- To optimize for readability, content within popovers uses left-alignment.
- Be mindful of the popover content that could overflow the viewport, and avoid popovers that flex 100% of the container width.
- Popovers have a default width of `280px`, but they can be adapted to have different sizes, depending on the content being wrapped.

### Behavior

- By default, popovers fade in on hover or focus of its trigger element. 
- Occasionally, a popover can fade in on page load. These should be used sparingly (no more than one per page), and always contain a dismiss button. Consider using these popovers to highlight a new feature or area.
- They fade out upon interacting with an area or element outside of the popover or its trigger, or on a delay of the cursor moving outside the popover or its trigger element.
- Similar to [tooltips](/components/tooltip), popovers have a default delay of `500ms` on `show` to help confirm hover intent and ensure that:
  - A user doesn’t accidentally hover an element with a popover, which might cover an adjacent element they intended to select.
  - The UI isn‘t constantly showing popovers when a user is moving their mouse over the page.

### Content

- All copy within a popover should be short, actionable, and use clear language. 
- The copy in the header should be shorter and even more concise than the copy in the body of the popover. 
- The body can contain a link, for example, a "Learn more" link takes the user to the Docs page for more info.
