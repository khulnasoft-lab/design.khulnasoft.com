Alerts allow the application to pass along relevant system information to the user without impeding their journey. Alerts are system generated and may or may not be derived by a user's action. They are not [validation](https://design.gitlab.com/components/forms#validation) error messages, nor are they feedback notifications after the user takes action, see [toasts](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toast) for more information. Alerts may contain a dismiss button and an action button depending on the situation. 

## Usage

|Component type|Purpose|
| --- | --- |
|Danger alerts| To advise the user that their attention is needed to address a critical issue in the system. |
|Warning alerts|To caution the user that their attention may be needed due to an issue in the system, however, it is not critical that they take action.|
|Information alerts| To provide supplemental information to the user in regards to the action they are about to take.| 
|Tip alerts| To educate the user about new or unused features, and other useful information.|
|Success alerts| To reaffirm to the user that a prior action they have taken, often in a different location within the application, has been accepted by the system. |


### When to use alerts

Alerts should be used when the system needs to notify the user of its status or to provide the user with information about their current experience. Deciding when to use a broadcast message, error, toast or, an alert can be tricky. See the below use cases to get a better understanding of when to use an alert:

| Alert | Use case | Example |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Danger | Configuration issue | Use a danger alert when there is a configuration issue with the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. |
| Warning | Potential issue | Use a warning alert when the user has added an SSH key that doesn't appear to be public. |  
| Information | Provide supplemental information | Use an information alert in Settings/Export-project to detail what will happen when a user exports a project.  |
| Tip | Promotional offer  | Use a tip alert in Operations/Kubernetes to make the user aware of a GCP credit offer. |
| Success | Subsequent confirmation of a proper configuration | Use a success alert in the pipeline view after the user activates SAST using the Web IDE and the SAST job runs properly for the first time. |

### When not to use alerts

There are times when using an alternative component other than an alert is necessary to provide the best experience to the user. See the following use cases to get a better idea of when not to use an alert: 

| Component | Use case | Example | Why an alert was not used |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Broadcast Message](https://design.gitlab.com/components/broadcast-messages) | Deliver critical, user-generated messages to all users | Use a broadcast message when an admin wants to relay a critical message to all users at the instance level. | Broadcast messages are created by an admin and not the system. We want to differentiate between system-generated and user-generated messages, hence a broadcast message is used in this case. |
| [Validation error](https://design.gitlab.com/components/forms#validation) | Notification of an invalid action | Use an error when the user has entered invalid characters into the project name field. | A validation error is tied to a specific invalid action that the user performed, whereas danger alerts inform users of when something has gone wrong separate from any immediate action the user has taken. |
| [Toast](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toast) | Immediate confirmation of an action | Use a toast when the user has dismissed a vulnerability and it no longer appears in the list.  |  We want to immediately reaffirm to the user the system recognized their action and that no further action is needed on their part. |
