### When to use

### Behavior

- 

## Usage

A user should know what action is needed to upload the file and for what purpose. For example, the action “Upload avatar” paired with a “Choose file…” button.

After the upload begins, use the [spinner component](/components/spinner) and live text indicating the percentage complete. For example, “Uploading image - 87%.”

### Types

| Component type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Single file uploader | Uploads a single file. For example, an avatar for your profile, group, or project.  |
| Multiple file uploader | Uploads one or more files in a single upload. For example, uploading multiple files to the design tab, a directory, or through the markdown textarea. |
