File uploaders are used to upload files from your computer.

## Usage

A file uploader should state the action needed to take in order to upload your file and a user should have the understanding of where a file is going to be uploaded. A couple common examples for how someone can upload a file is through clicking and selecting the file from your computer or through dragging and dropping a file from your computer to the file uploader.

### Dos and Dontâ€™s

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Create a dashed border around the file uploader to indicate the upload/dropzone area | Exclude a description on how to upload a file |
| Give the option to drag and drop a file to upload |  |
| Darken the dashed border with a hand cursor on hover to indicate the clickable area |  |
| Have a visible `Upload` and `Cancel` button to finalize or cancel upload |  |
