File uploaders are used to upload files from your computer or device. The accepted file types will be determined by the context of the file uploader.

## Usage

A user should know what action is needed to upload the file and for what purpose. For example, the action “Upload an image for your avatar.” paired with a “Choose file…” button. You should display an animated spinner icon and percentage of upload completion after the file is chosen for upload. This provides a status of the upload and serves to indicate issues, if any.

### Dos and Dont’s

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Create a dashed border around the file uploader to indicate the upload/dropzone area. | Exclude a description on how to upload a file. |
| Give the option to drag and drop a file to upload. |  |
| Darken the dashed border with a hand cursor on hover to indicate the clickable area. |  |
| Have “Upload” (or similar verbiage) and “Cancel” buttons to complete or cancel uploading. |  |
