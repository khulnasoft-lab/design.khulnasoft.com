Tables are used to render tabular data in a basic grid, making it easier for people to scan it. Tables are comprised of cells, columns, and rows.

## Usage

Use tables when: 

* Users need to review, enter, or edit uniform sets of data or options. 
* Displaying structured content, where each entry has the same attributes.

### When to use tables

Use tables to:

* Display large volumes of data.
* Display a data set that will continue to grow; for example, a table used to display users, environments, and so on.
* Compare data in a set to in a way that makes each data point distinguishable.
* Search, filter, or sort by all parameters in a data set.

### When not to use tables

Do not use tables to:

* Display a list of continuous, vertical indexes of text or images. Use [Lists](/components/list) instead.
* Display contained content and actions on a single topic. Use [Cards](/components/cards) instead.
* For hierarchical structures. Use the [Tree](/components/tree) view instead.

## Layout

Tables take up the full width of their container element. However, it is important to note that wide tables make it difficult to read and scan small amounts of content, because the data is widely separated. For legibility, ensure content is laid out and aligned properly.

Don’t simply shrink an entire table to fit the viewport or apply a fixed width to a table to the point that it compromises legibility. The same way stretching tables 100% to the width of the viewport is not recommended, a small, shrunken table view can create a cluttered interface. Use a responsive table view instead.

Prevent horizontal scrolling to ensure the table doesn't break the layout. Tables work across multiple screen sizes and conform to [responsive guidelines](/components/tables/#responsiveness).

### Empty state

A table's empty state displays when there is no data, yet. [See empty states guidelines](/regions/empty-states).

### Content alignment

Left align content by importance, based on the information needs of your users. In some circumstances, right aligning data helps with comprehension. For example, numeric data is easier to read when right aligned. To aid scanning on right-aligned data, make sure to use the same number of decimal places for all numeric data. Tables may switch their alignment for right-to-left audiences as well.

Text in tables tends to end up in narrow columns. Don't justify or center the text; it causes confusion and harms readability.

## Table anatomy

### Cells

A cell’s width and height will change according to its content.

It is possible to hyphenate the text inside table cells, but note that hyphens are language sensitive. The ability to find break opportunities depends on the language, defined in the `lang` attribute of a parent element, and support depends on the specific browser.

#### Truncation

To fit a long string of text into a table cell, you can shorten the text with an ellipsis (“...”) to show exactly where the text is truncated. On hover, the truncated text should display a tooltip that includes the full text. [See tooltips guidelines](/components/tooltips)

#### Empty values

If a cell is empty or unavailable, keep the cell empty to reduce noise and help with legibility.

### Columns

Avoid making all the columns an even width. The table columns should be sized according to the data they contain. Columns of small content should be narrow, while columns of paragraphs should be relatively wide. Allow the browser to lay out the tables according to the viewport size.

#### Ordering & sorting

The data set of a table is usually ordered by one specific column representing an attribute, such as status, last updated, or priority.

Sorting is designed as a native functionality of tables, and should not be confused with the [list sorting](/components/sorting) component.

When sorting is enabled for the table, a [sorting icon](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=sort) is displayed next to the column header. A sortable table is identified by the sorting icon that is present in the header cells. Clicking the icon will sort the rows based on the selected column, in ascending order first, and subsequently toggling between ascending and descending order. The sorting icon and functionality should not be visible on responsive tables.

Sorting can be disabled to prevent users from changing the sorting order of a column. The default order will utilize one specific attribute.

### Rows

Rows can have a mix of read-only and editable cells with content populated by users. When designing a table, make sure the cells work well together and fit nicely in the rows.

### Header

A table header is the row at the top of the table that helps identify the columns below. The header provides clarity if data is non-descriptive or ambiguous. Labels in a header should be short, descriptive, and relevant. Avoid headers that are too long for the content in the rows below, and use title-case capitalization for table headers and labels.

Always use column or row headers, unless all columns in a table have self-descriptive content, like names, dates, and so on. For example, a header in Audit Events is redundant:

## Interaction

When including triggers to manipulate the data, such as filters, they should be placed directly above the table.

Additional actions a user can take from an individual table row are displayed in the far right column, and are visible at all times (no on-hover visibility). If there are two or more actions in a table row, consider using a button group or a ["more menu" button](/components/button#ellipsis) with a dropdown list option.

It is also possible to use in-line links to provide additional information to other items in the table or route the user to a different page.

## Pagination

Tables can include pagination. Pagination works by presenting a set number of rows in a view, with the ability to navigate to another set. [See pagination guidelines](/components/pagination)

Tables with more than 20 items require pagination which is always located below the table and takes the form of a button group. Pagination is generally not required on tables with 20 or fewer items.

## Styling

Use white space in tables to improve scannability, visually separating data elements so that each can be individually identified and read as separate from the others.

To help with styling, use horizontal lines between rows to visually separate content. Avoid any border or frame surrounding the table. Do not style tables to look like nets, with every number enclosed. 

Do not appply vertical lines between columns. In general, tables without vertical lines look better and are easier to scan and read.

## Responsiveness

Users may view an application on any device, so ensure the table will be usable whether displayed on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

## Accessibility

Use proper semantic markup, so that users of screen readers can navigate through the table one cell at a time, hearing column and row headers spoken to them.

* `<th>` should not contain heading elements.
* `<th>` should be descriptive and relevant.
* `<th>` should have a defined `scope` attribute to establish relationships between the table headings and rows/columns; for example, `<th scope="col">`.
* `<caption>` should be used to provide a title for a table.
* `<caption>` should be an immediate child element of `<table>`.
