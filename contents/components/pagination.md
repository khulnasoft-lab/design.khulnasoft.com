Breaking up lists and distributing the results either by the use of pagination or by infinite scroll helps the user parse a large number of items whenever there are too many results to show at once. We use both pagination and infinite scroll to segment results depending on the user’s task.

## Definitions

**Pagination** breaks up results into several pages with controls for navigating to a specific page and to the next or previous pages.

**Infinite scroll** loads the next batch of items in a list once the user has reached the bottom of the page and thus removes the need for pagination.

## Usage

| | Pagination | Infinite Scroll |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Description:** | Benefits users who are looking for a specific item in a list to complete their task. | Benefits users who are browsing through lists with content that updates frequently. |
| **When to use:** | To be used on any list that can be sorted and/or filtered. | To be used on lists with no sort/filter functionality. Lists that only have a search function should use infinite scroll and not be considered in the sorted/filtered category. |
| **Examples:** | Issues and Todos dashboards | Activity dashboards and the Commits page |

### Pagination
Lists with **more than 20** items require pagination which is always located below the list and takes the form of a [button](components/button) group. No pagination is required on lists with 20 or fewer items.

#### Behavior

##### Truncation
Truncation is shown using `…` when the number of pages exceeds the pagination display limit. By default `…` are shown after the **5th page** on large and medium viewports and after the **2nd page** on small and mobile viewports.

Double truncation occurs when the current page is separated by 5 or more pages from the first and last page on large and medium viewports. On small and mobile viewports, double truncation occurs when 1 or more pages separate the current page from the first and last page.

### Infinite scroll
Infinite scroll is triggered once the user has reached the 20th item of a list and there are more items to load. A read-only [loading spinner](component/spinner) button appears at the bottom of the list for the duration of the load time.

#### Behavior

##### List count

Always display a counter that details how many items have already loaded and how many items remain below lists with infinite scroll, giving the user an indication of where they are relative to the list.

##### Returning to a list
When a user returns to a list from a list entry using the back button in the browser, they should be returned to the same place in the list where they left off.
