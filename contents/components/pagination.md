Breaking up lists and distributing the results either by the use of pagination or by [infinite scroll](/components/infinite-scroll) helps the user parse a large number of items whenever there are too many results to show at once. We use both pagination and infinite scroll to segment results depending on the user’s task.

## Definition

Pagination breaks up results into several pages with controls for navigating to a specific page and to the next or previous pages.

## Usage

Pagination is similar to infinite scroll, so use the table below as a guide for choosing when to use either component.

| | Pagination | Infinite Scroll |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Description:** | Benefits users who are looking for a specific item in a list to complete their task. | Benefits users who are browsing through lists with content that updates frequently. |
| **When to use:** | To be used on any list that can be sorted and/or filtered. | To be used on lists with no sort/filter functionality. Lists that only have a search function should use infinite scroll and not be considered in the sorted/filtered category. |
| **Examples:** | Issues and Todos dashboards | Activity dashboards and the Commits page |

### Behavior

Lists with **more than 20** items require pagination which is always located below the list and takes the form of a [button group](/components/buttons/#group). Pagination is generally not required on lists with **20 or fewer** items but can be considered depending on the context (i.e. the paginated list is embedded within another component).

#### Anchoring

Always anchor to the top of the list when the user interacts with the pagination component. Doing so reduces scrolling on the part of the user while keeping them on task. 

#### Truncation

Truncation is shown using `…` when the number of pages exceeds the pagination display limit. By default `…` are shown after the **5th page** on large and medium viewports and after the **2nd page** on small and mobile viewports.

Double truncation occurs when the current page is separated by 5 or more pages from the first and last page on large and medium viewports. On small and mobile viewports, double truncation occurs when 1 or more pages separate the current page from the first and last page.
