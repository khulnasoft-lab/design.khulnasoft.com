A list consists of related pieces of information grouped together, clearly associated to each other. Lists are easy to read and maintain, and they provide a good structural point of view for interface elements. 

Lists are frequently used for navigation, cards, tabs, breadcrumbs, dropdown content, and general text blocks.

## Usage

- A list must contain one or more list elements.
- Arrange items in a logical way, for example, in alphabetical or numeric order, by use case, or preference.
- Use a list to group a continuous set of text and images, for example, a list of members of a project.

## Types

- **Unordered list**: List items using plain bullets. The bullets might be omitted in the UI. Uses the `<ul>` tag.
- **Ordered list**: Display different numbers to list each list item. Uses the `<ol>` tag.
- **Definition list**: Arranges  items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary. Uses the `<dl>` tag.

### List layout types

List items can have single or multiple lines of text, being three the maximum number of lines.

A list contain a single column of content, and each list item is place in an individual row.

Lists are commonly layed out vertically, but the items can be position horizontally depending on CSS styles -- see [Tabs](/components/tabs).
