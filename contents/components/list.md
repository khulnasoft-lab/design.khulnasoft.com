## Guidelines

### When to use

- A list must contain one or more list elements.
- Arrange items in a logical way. For example, in alphabetical or numeric order, or according to a specific use case. Lists can also sometimes be rearranged based on a users' preference if a [sort](/components/sorting) component is available.
- Use a list to group a continuous set of text and images. For example, a list of members of a project.

### When not to use

Todo: Add when not to use.

### Variants

- **Unordered list**: The order of list items is not strict. List items are marked with plain bullets, which may be omitted in the UI. Uses the `<ul>` tag.
- **Ordered list**: The order of list items is strict. List items are marked with numbers. Uses the `<ol>` tag.
- **Definition list**: The order of list items matches that of a dictionary. Uses the `<dl>` tag.

### Content

- List items can have single or multiple lines of text, with a maximum of three lines.
- A list contains a single column of content, and each list item is placed in an individual row.
- Lists are commonly laid out vertically, but the items can be positioned horizontally depending on CSS styles. For example, see [Tabs](/components/tabs).

### Accessibility

Todo: Add accessibility guidelines.
