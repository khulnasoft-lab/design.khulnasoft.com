A list consists of related pieces of information grouped together, clearly associated to each other. Lists are easy to read and maintain, and they provide a good structural point of view for interface elements. 

Lists are frequently used for navigation, cards, tabs, breadcrumbs, dropdown content, and general text block.

## Usage

- A list must contain one or more list elements.
- Arrange items in a logical way, for example, in alphabetical or numeric order.
- Use a list to group a continuous set of text and images, for example, a list of members of a project.

## Types

- **Unordered list**: List items using plain bullets. Uses the `<ul>` tag.
- **Ordered list**: Display different numbers to list each list item. Uses the `<ol>` tag.
- **Definition list**: Arranges  items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary. Uses the `<dl>` tag.

### List layout types

- **Single-line list**: list items contain a maximum of one line of text.
- **Two-line list**: list items contain a maximum of two lines of text.
- **Three-line list**: list items contains a maximum of three lines of text.

A list contain a single column of content, and each list item is place in an individual row.

Lists are commonly layed out vertically, but the items can be position horizontally depending on CSS styles -- see [Tabs](/components/tabs).
