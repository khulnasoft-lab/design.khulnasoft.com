name: Labels

Labels are editable objects that allow users to manually categorize other objects, like issues, merge requests, and epics. They have a name, description, and a customizable color. They provide a quick way to recognize which categories the labeled object belongs to.

Labels should not be confused with [badges](/components/badges). Badges highlight more generic object metadata that are not categories.

## Usage

The labels that categorize an object are usually displayed in that object's detail page and in list views, next to the corresponding object. Clicking on a label navigates the user to a list view filtered by that label. Users can also manually filter lists and other types of views by labels.

In most places, a label's description is shown in a [tooltip](/components/tooltips). In a group or project [labels list](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/labels), users can view all label information and perform actions on them.
