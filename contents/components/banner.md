## Guidelines

### When to use 

- Inform a user of a feature that isn't enabled.
- Promote a new feature.
- Solicit user feedback. 

### When not to use

- Communicate when a feature has not yet been configured or used. For example, when the security dashboard needs further setup or no issues have been added to a project. Instead, use an [empty-state](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states).
- Give tips and hints on the use of a feature. For example, configuring a review app. Instead, use a tip style [alert](/components/alert).

### Variants

- **Basic Introduction**: Provides a basic introduction to help users get started with an existing feature.
- **Promotion with Banner**: A promotional Banner with an illustration that encourages upgrading to new features.
- **Basic Promotion**: Same as `Promotion with Banner`, but without an illustration.

### Behavior

- A banner can always be dismissed.
  - It doesn't reappear by default and in rare circumstances, the banner can appear again after some time has passed.
  - When temporarily dismissed, it will reappear after **7 days**.
- The action should direct a user to docs for an installation guide or to where they can upgrade their plan to enable a feature.

### Content

- Title should be concise and indicate the purpose of the banner.
- The message describes the benefits of using or upgrading to a feature or the benefit of providing feedback.
- An optional illustration uses the [medium](/product-foundations/illustration#medium) size, and supports the message.

### Accessibility

- When an illustration is used, it should be hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
