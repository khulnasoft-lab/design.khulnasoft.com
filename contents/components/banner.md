Banners promote user awareness for new features or high-priority research initiatives. Unlike [alerts](/components/alert), banners are solely for in-product marketing or for conveying information about a priority feature or study to the user.

## Usage

Reserve banners for high priority features or initiatives that benefit the user. Banners can be placed either inline with the content or at the top of a page depending on the promotion and the context.

### When to use banners

Use banners to:

- Inform a user of a feature that has yet to be enabled. For example, Auto DevOps.
- Promote a new feature. For example, a free trial of GitLab Ultimate featuring the new squash commit functionality in merge requests.
- Solicit user feedback. For example, evaluating a set of new features to help prioritize your roadmap through a survey. 

### When not to use banners

Do not use banners to:

- Communicate when a feature has not yet been configured or used. For example, when the security dashboard needs further setup or no issues have been added to a project. Instead, use an [empty-state](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states).
- Give tips and hints on the use of a feature. For example, configuring a review app. Instead, use a tip style [alert](/components/alert).

### Dos and Dont's

| Do | Don't |
| ------ | ------ |
| Use to promote a new or unconfigured feature. | Use to communicate system status or events to the user. Instead, use an [alert](/components/alert). |
| Allow banners to be dismissible. | Use banners to communicate instruction or critical information that should not be dismissible by a user. |
| Use sparingly and with consideration of other components in proximity. | Overuse and clutter the experience with promotions. |
| Display to users who can take immediate action if they desire. | Display to users who cannot activate the feature or benefit from its use. |

### Specifications

#### Container

Banners appear within containers in the page or section. This is important for dismissible elements as it gives the banner a temporal visual affordance, indicating to users that this component is not permanent.

#### Dismiss action

The dismiss action is always represented by the `Close` icon and anchored to the top right of the banner.

Banner dismissal should work as follows:
* Banner dismissal must be associated with the user in the system database. Dismissal must persist, even across version upgrades and clients.
* Banners do not reappear by default. In rare circumstances, you may present the banner again to a user after some time has passed.
* Banners should only be shown to users who are logged in.

**Implementation Notes:**
* The dismissal of the banner is achieved using the `UserCallout` model on the backend and the `PersistentUserCallout` JS file on the frontend. If both parameters are implemented correctly, the banner will adhere to the dismissal guidelines above.

You may also introduce the option to temporarily dismiss the banner by including a secondary or tertiary button placed alongside the primary action button, following the [button](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button#alignment-and-order) guidelines.

Temporary dismissals should work as follows: 
* Banners dismissed temporarily will reappear after **7 days**.
* After a banner is dismissed temporarily, use a [toast](/components/toast) message to let the user know they will see the banner again in 7 days.

#### Header

The header should always be present and written to follow our [voice and tone](https://design.gitlab.com/content/voice-tone/) guidelines.

#### Paragraph

The supporting text should be concise and only include information specific to what is being promoted. The content should also follow our [voice and tone](https://design.gitlab.com/content/voice-tone/) guidelines.

#### Illustration *(optional)*

A small illustration may be used but is optional. Keep in mind size and placement when including an [illustration](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/illustration).

#### Call to action

A banner should always include a [button](https://design.gitlab.com/components/button) as the primary call to action. Avoid using multiple buttons to link the user to different pages. An exception can be made in cases where we need to [help users](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/helping-users) by linking to documentation or allowing the user to temporarily dismiss the banner.
