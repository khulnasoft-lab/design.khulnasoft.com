## Guidelines

### When to use 

- Inform a user of a feature that has yet to be enabled. For example, Auto DevOps.
- Promote a new feature. For example, a free trial of GitLab Ultimate featuring the new squash commit functionality in merge requests.
- Solicit user feedback. For example, evaluating a set of new features to help prioritize your roadmap through a survey. 

### When not to use

- Communicate when a feature has not yet been configured or used. For example, when the security dashboard needs further setup or no issues have been added to a project. Instead, use an [empty-state](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states).
- Give tips and hints on the use of a feature. For example, configuring a review app. Instead, use a tip style [alert](/components/alert).

### Variants

- **Basic Introduction**: Provides a basic introduction to help users get started with an existing feature.
- **Promotion with Banner**: A promotional Banner with an illustration that encourages upgrading to new features.
- **Basic Promotion**: Same as `Promotion with Banner`, but without an illustration.

### Behaviors

- Title should be concise, describing the Banner content or feature being promoted.
- Description describes the benefits of a feature, if encouraged to upgrade or to use that feature.
- Banners do not reappear by default. In rare circumstances, you may present the banner again to a user after some time has passed.
- Banners dismissed temporarily will reappear after **7 days**.
- Primary button directs users to docs for an installation guide or to upgrade their plan to enable features.

### Accessibility

- When an illustration is used, the illustration should be hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
