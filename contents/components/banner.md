Banners promote user awareness for new or unused features. Unlike [alerts](/components/alerts), banners are solely for in-product marketing, conveying information about a priority feature to the user. Designating the use of a banner should be the result of careful consideration and planning between a Designer and their Product Manager. The use of banners should be reserved for high priority features and configurations that would benefit the user to activate. 

## Usage

| :white_check_mark: Do | :stop_sign: Don't |
| ------ | ------ |
| Use to promote a new or unconfigured feature. | Use to communicate system status or events to the user. Instead use an [alert](/components/alerts). |
| Allow banners to be dismissable. | Use banners to communicate information that, if removed, would negatively impact the experience. | 
| Use sparingly and with consideration of other components in proximity. | Overuse and clutter the experience with promotions. | 
| Display to users who can take immediate action if they desire.  | Display to users who cannot activate the feature or benfit from its use.  | 

Banners can be placed either inline with the content or pinned to the top of a page. The location is flexible depending on the promotion and the context in which the promotion is taking place.

### Typical elements of a banner:
* Container
* Dismiss action *(required)*
* Headline
* Paragraph
* Illustration *(optional)*
* Call to action
