## Structure

<figure-img alt="Numbered diagram of a banner structure" label="Banner structure" src="/img/banner-structure.svg"></figure-img>

1. **Container**: Wraps the content.
1. **Illustration** (optional): Compliments the content.
1. **Title**: Header for the content.
1. **Message**: Text content indicating the purpose and potential next steps.
1. **Dismissal**: Removes the banner for a user.
1. **Action**: A single button to provide an explicit action the user can take based on the message.

## Guidelines

### When to use

A banner should be used sparingly and with consideration of its impact to neighboring components and the overall user experience to:

- Inform a user of a feature that isn't enabled.
- Promote a new feature within a single major version.
- Solicit user feedback.

### When not to use

- If you need to communicate that a feature hasn't been configured or used, consider using an [empty state](/patterns/empty-states) instead.
- If you're giving tips and hints for an existing or established feature, consider the [tip alert variant](/components/alert#variants) instead.
- If you need to communicate system status, consider using an [alert](/components/alert) instead.
- If a user can't take immediate action, activate a feature, or benefit from the content, then the banner shouldn't be displayed.

### Variants

- **Introduction**: Provide a basic introduction to help users get started with an existing feature. Illustration optional.
- **Promotion**: A promotional message to encourage exploring or upgrading to a new feature. Illustration optional.

### Behavior

- A banner can always be dismissed.
  - It doesn't reappear by default, but in rare circumstances the banner can reappear after 7 days have passed.
- The action should direct a user to one of the following:
  - Docs for an installation guide.
  - Where they can upgrade their plan to enable a feature.
  - A format for contributing or providing feedback.
- When using a banner to solicit feedback, ensure a clear metric of success is set to remove the banner once complete. For example, using a banner to collect survey responses and removing the banner once 100 responses are collected.

### Content

- Title should be concise and indicate the purpose of the banner.
- The message describes the benefits of performing the action.
- An optional [illustration](/product-foundations/illustration) to support the message uses the [small](/product-foundations/illustration#grid-and-size) illustration size and [round](/product-foundations/illustration#shape) container shape.

### Placement

- Similar to [alert placement](/components/alert#placement), the content within the banner will determine its placement on the page.
- Generally speaking, an introduction banner should be used at the page-level and relate to all content on the page, whereas a promotion banner can either be used at the page-level or in-page level. If in-page level is used, the banner should be placed directly above the content it relates to.

<figure-img alt="Page level banner position" label="Introduction banner at the top of the page" src="/img/banner-page-level.png" width="332"></figure-img>

<figure-img alt="Page level banner position" label="In-page banner above the content it relates to" src="/img/banner-in-page.png" width="332"></figure-img>

### Accessibility

- When an illustration is used, it should be hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.
