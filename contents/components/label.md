Labels should not be confused with [badges](/components/badge). Badges highlight more generic object metadata that are not categories.

## Usage

Labels are usually displayed in that object's detail page and in list views, next to the corresponding object. Clicking on a label navigates the user to a list view filtered by that label. Users can also manually filter lists and other types of views by labels.

In most places, a label's description is shown in a [tooltip](/components/tooltip) when hovering the label. But if the label's description appears on the page with no need for user interaction, do not show it in a tooltip.

### Scoped labels

Scoped labels are a unique type of label, characterized by their mutually exclusive behavior. Each scoped label has a `key` and a `value`. An issue, epic, or merge request can only have one scoped label of a specific `key`. For example, if an issue has the label `workflow::ready for design`, it cannot have any other `workflow::` labels at the same time. Applying a second `workflow::` label will automatically replace the former. 

A scoped label is visually differentiated from a regular label by the contrasting colors on the left and right sides of the label.
