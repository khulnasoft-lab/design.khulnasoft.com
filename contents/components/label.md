## Guidelines

### When to use

Todo: Add when to use.

### When not to use

- If displaying more generic object metadata that are not categories, consider using [badges](/components/badge). 

### Variants

1. **Scoped Labels**: Scoped labels are a unique type of label, characterized by their mutually exclusive behavior. Each scoped label has a `key` and a `value`. An issue, epic, or merge request can only have one scoped label of a specific `key`. For example, if an issue has the label `workflow::ready for design`, it cannot have any other `workflow::` labels at the same time. Applying a second `workflow::` label will automatically replace the former. A scoped label is visually differentiated from a regular label by the contrasting colors on the left and right sides of the label.

### Behavior

- Clicking on a label navigates the user to a list view filtered by that label.
- Users can manually filter lists and other types of views by labels.

### Content

#### Description

- A label's description is shown in a [tooltip](/components/tooltip) when hovering the label.

### Accessibility

Todo: Add accessibility guidelines.
