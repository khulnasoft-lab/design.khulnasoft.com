## Guidelines

### When to use

- In a form for a user to indicate a selection of one option from a list of six or more options, or when the number of options isn't known.
- For selecting from a list options to sort a set of options, and when no sort order is needed (see the [sorting](/components/sorting) component for a comparison).
- Along with [pagination](/components/pagination) to select the number of results per view.

### When not to use

- If only one option can be selected, and the number of options is five or less, consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If the user needs to easily see all options, consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If selecting between a binary state that has immediate effect, consider using a [toggle](/components/toggle) instead.
- If choices exist outside of a form and as a list of options, use a [combobox](/components/dropdown-combobox) instead.
- A select should not be used for navigation.
