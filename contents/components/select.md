## Guidelines

### When to use
- To indicate a selection of a single item from a list of options.
- To present sort options when the sort order button isn't required (see the [sorting](/components/sorting) component for a comparison).

### When not to use

- If there are five or less options to select from or the user needs to easily see all of options, then consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If more than one option can be selected, consider using [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) instead.
- If the option is a binary decision that takes immediate effect, consider using a [toggle](/components/toggle) instead.
- If selecting from a list of options outside of a [form](/patterns/form) or for more complex interactions, then a combobox is preferred.
