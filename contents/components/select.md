## Guidelines

### When to use

- In a form for a user to indicate a selection of only one option from a list of six or more options, or when the number of options is unknown.
- If choosing only one option from a list of options and there is no need for a sorting direction (see the [sorting](/components/sorting) component for a comparison).

### When not to use

- If only one option can be selected, and the number of options is five or less, consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If more than one option can be selected, consider using [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) or a [combobox](/components/dropdown-combobox) instead.
- If the user needs to easily see all options, consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If selecting between a binary state that has immediate effect, consider using a [toggle](/components/toggle) instead.
- If choices exist outside of a form and as a list of options, use a [combobox](/components/dropdown-combobox) instead.
