## Guidelines

### When to use
- Indicate a selection of only one from a list of options.
- To present sort options when the sort order button isn't required (see the [sorting](/components/sorting) component for a comparison).

### When not to use

- If only one option can be selected, the number of options is five or less, or the user needs to easily see all of options, consider using [radio buttons](/components/radio-button) instead.
- If more than one option can be selected, consider using [checkboxes](/components/checkbox) instead.
- If the option is a binary decision that takes immediate effect, consider using a [toggle](/components/toggle) instead.
- For lists of options outside of a form, use a [combobox](/components/dropdown-combobox) instead.
