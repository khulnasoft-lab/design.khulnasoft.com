Accordion are used to regroup a set of specialized content and deliver it on users demand. Accordions gives users more granular control over the interface and help them comprehend larger content into smaller digestible parts.

## Usage

Accordions are displayed vertically stacked. They always contain a header, an icon reflecting its current state (collapsed or expanded), and a clearly identifiable body.

Todo: Add table Dos and Dontâ€™s

### Specifications

#### Header

Just like [modals](https://design.gitlab.com/components/modals/), the header of an accordion could be a question or a title. Either way, headers should give context about the underlying content in a concise and actictionable way.(eg."What can GitLab offer me?", "More options")

#### Icon

The icon should always reflect the state of the accordion (expanded or collapsed), and be located as close as possible to the header.

#### Body

The body should stand out from the rest of the page and be directly linked to the Header.

#### Interaction

Users should be able to expand and collapse the content by clicking a single area, wrapping the header and the icon.
