Broadcast messages provide an efficient and prominent way to deliver critical messages at the instance level to all users.

## Usage

Broadcast messages are always located at the top of the page, above the [global navigation](/regions/navigation). They use a background color that matches the available theme colors but should stand apart to ensure users notice the information.

Broadcast messages expire after a set period as defined by the admin but they can also be dismissed at the user level.

It is a rare usecase for multiple broadcast messages to be present at a given time. When this happens, however, the messages should stack.
