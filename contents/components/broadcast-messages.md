Broadcast messages provide an efficient and prominent way to deliver critical messages at the instance level to all users. For example, a broadcast message can be used when an admin wants to announce that their platform will experience downtime during a specific period.

Broadcast messages are created by an admin and not triggered by the system, like [system messages](/components/system-messages) or [alerts](/components/alerts).

## Usage

Broadcast messages are always located at the top of the page, above the [global navigation](/regions/navigation). They use a background color that matches the available theme colors but should stand apart to ensure users notice the information.

Broadcast messages expire after a set period as defined by the admin but they can also be dismissed at the user level.

Broadcast messages generally contain a small amount of content. It is a rare usecase for multiple broadcast messages to be present at a given time. When this happens, however, the messages should stack.
