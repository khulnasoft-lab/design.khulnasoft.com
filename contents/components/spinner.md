A spinner is a simple animated element that tells users that either saving or loading of information/data is in progress and is tied to user-triggered actions. In some cases of saving information the UI will reflect the change before the change is actually saved. In such cases, the spinner should be used to indicate background activity until information is successfully saved.

## Usage

Spinners attract attention because of their animation so they should be used sparingly. Ideally, only one spinner should be used at a time. [Skeleton loader](/components/skeleton-loader) should be used for indicating the loading of whole pages, spinners should be used on a small scale for small changes in the UI.

Spinners shouldn’t be used in combination with the skeleton loader, too much animation at once can be overwhelming. Either one or the other should be used.

Additionally, we add a 100 ms delay before showing the spinner to mitigate lots of unnecessary spinners showing up at the same time.

We use four spinner sizes:

- **Small**: 16 pixels
- **Medium**: 24 pixels
- **Large**: 32 pixels
- **Extra Large**: 64 pixels

and two spinner colors:

- **Dark**: `$grey-700`
- **Light**: white

### Sizes

#### Small

With its size at 16 pixels this spinner size is perfect for placing it alongside text labels. This is also the size that can be used inside other elements such as buttons or input fields.

#### Medium

This size can be used alongside other icons with a similar size. For example, the icons in the merge request widget used to indicate pipeline stage status, security scanning, and more are using this size.

#### Large

This size can be used for indicating that loading is in progress for larger components (for example charts and other interactive elements).

#### Extra Large

This size is the largest we allow for our spinners. It can be used for indicating that loading is in progress for content areas and sections of the UI.

### Colors

#### Dark

A neutral spinner with sufficient contrast helps indicate background activity while not inferring meaning or being too distracting.

#### Light

The light variant is reserved for spinners on a dark background. For example, primary buttons or in the context of a dark UI.
