These are text components used within the product.

## Inline code

Highlight an inline text element of code. Commonly used for a line of code, class names, and variable names.

## Code blocks

Display a block of code. Commonly used for multi-line code and to display code with syntax highlighting.

Code blocks should fit the width of the parent container. Code content will scroll horizontally if it overflows the block.
