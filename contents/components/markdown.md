Markdown is used for formatting text content within the product.

## Documentation Markdown typescale

Documentation Markdown is defined as any markdown that is written outside of issuable pages, such as a README or Wiki page. Content written using Markdown includes typography that contains fixed margins and increased line-heights to improve readability. Label text is not available for documentation Markdown because all Markdown is considered long-form content.

### Base

`16px` is the base size of body copy for documentation Markdown.

### Responsive

The `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` headers within our documentation Markdown scale are responsive. All other type options within this scale are not dependent on screen size.

## Compact Markdown typescale

Within certain views, the Markdown type scale is decreased in order to more closely align copy with other UI components. Compact Markdown is used for descriptions and comments on issue and merge request pages. Label text is not available for compact Markdown because all Markdown is long-form content.

### Base

`14px` is the base size of body copy for compact markdown.

### Responsive

The `h1` header within our compact markdown scale is responsive. All other type options within this scale are not dependent on screen size.

## Inline code

Highlight an inline text element of code. Commonly used for a line of code, class names, and variable names. The size of the text will adjust based on the parent text size.

## Code blocks

Display a block of code. Commonly used for multi-line code and to display code with syntax highlighting. The size of the text will adjust based on the parent text size.

Code blocks should fit the width of the parent container. Code content will scroll horizontally if it overflows the block.
