A radio button typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Each radio button is boolean and only one can be selected at a time. Itâ€™s possible to have one radio button selected by default, but not a requirement.

## Usage

* Use radio buttons to present a set of options, where only one option can be selected at a time.
* A vertical (stacked) layout is preferred, with one radio button per line. For sets of two with short labels where wrapping or width constraints are not an issue the inline (horizontal) layout is acceptable.
* If a radio button represents the default choice (or previously selected in the case of settings), use the `checked` attribute.
* Radio buttons may replace segmented controls, a list of checkboxes (when only one option can be selected), or a toggle to allow users to choose between two or more options. For help with choosing the right solution, follow the table below.

### Legends, Labels, and Help Text
* Radio button labels are set in regular font weight, positioned to the right of the element, and should be as short as possible.
* Use a `fieldset` with `legend` (set in bold font weight and positioned above the group of radio buttons) to group a set of radio buttons. Some screen readers will announce the contents of the legend before each nested input to maintain context for a user.
* [Help text](/components/forms#help-text) can be added below the radio button labels or as a paragraph below the group label.

### Visual Design

Radio buttons use high-contrast colors for labels and default browser UI to indicate selected and unselected states.

### Interaction

Users are able to select an option with click/tap on either the radio button or its label. Selecting one option unselects all others.
