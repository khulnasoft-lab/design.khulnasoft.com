A toggle is a visual switch which acts as a boolean.

## Usage

Use toggles when there is a choice between two selections, it has a default state, the results are effective and noticeable immediately, and there is **no need** for a user to click a submit button.

Avoid using toggles when a submit button is needed. This confuses users and dilutes the experience by preventing instant results.

Use the following table to see when a toggle should be used over other alternative components.

|  | [Single checkbox](/components/checkbox) | [Toggle](/components/toggle) | [Single-select dropdown](/components/dropdown) | [Radio buttons](/components/radio-button) | [Segmented control](/components/segmented-control) | [Multiple checkboxes](/components/checkbox) | [Multi-select dropdown](/components/dropdown) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Available options | 1 | 1 | >1 or unknown | >1 and <6 | >1 and <6 | >1 and <6 | >1 or unknown |
| Selectable options | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | >1 or even all | >1 or even all |
| Pre-selected options | Possible | Possible | Possible | Yes, 1 | Yes, 1 | Possible | Possible |
| Disabled options | Possible | Possible | Possible | Possible | No | Possible | Possible |
| Option descriptions | Possible | Possible | Possible | Possible | No | Possible | Possible |
| UI space | Little room | Not a problem | Little room | Not a problem | Not a problem | Not a problem | Little room |
| Example | Accepting terms and conditions on sign up | Enabling/disabling project features | “Sort by” dropdowns | Project visibility setting | 7, 30, 90 days timeframe in analytics dashboards | Scopes selection in User settings > Applications | Add/remove labels |

### Labels

Toggle labels are set in bold, positioned above the element by default, and should concisely describe what the control does when the toggle is on.

In rare cases and exceptions, the label can be placed to the left of the toggle. Examples include non-inline (block) positioned elements. 

### Description and help text

A description and help text are only used for the default toggle.

A 1–2 sentence description can go underneath the label to describe the purpose or intent of the toggle. The description is different from help text in that help text can clarify the outcome of changing the toggle state, while the description provides an explanation or instructions.

Consider using a description to provide an explanation beyond what a label infers.

Use `aria-describedby` to associate the description and help text with the toggle for screen reader users.


### Visual Design

Toggles should use high-contrast colors to indicate the states - On and Off.
