## Structure

## Guidelines

### When to use

- If there are only a few options and enough room to fit within the UI.

### When not to use

<todo>Add when not to use items.</todo>

### Appearance

#### Buttons (Options)

- Each button must be equal in width and prominence.
- Button labels should ideally be only one word.

#### Labels

- Label positioning rules are the same as they are for [forms](/patterns/forms). They can be placed to the left of segmented control when there’s a lack of vertical space. But by default, the label comes above the segmented control.
- The label can be omitted in cases when it’s clear what the segmented control is referring to from the UI (for example, switching between a day, week or month view in a calendar UI).
- Alternatively, icons can be used to replace button labels.

### Behavior

- Results are effective and visible immediately.

### Content

- Contain 2 or 3 options and should not go beyond 5.

### Accessibility
