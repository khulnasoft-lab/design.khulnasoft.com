A color picker allows users to customize a component by choosing a color option. It is only available in instances where a user is adding bespoke content that needs to be differentiated.

## Usage

The color picker comes in two parts: the input field and the color swatch preview. 

The input field must be pre-populated with the default value of `#6699CC`. The color swatch preview allows a user to visualize what HEX code is currently inputted.

The user may edit the color by choosing a new color from the list of suggestions or by using the color picker popover. They can also specify a specific color by entering a HEX value. The user must never be forced to use only one of the two input methods.

When using the input field, users are able to only enter HEX formats. For example, the user can type `#000` or `#000000`. The color picker will translate the format.
