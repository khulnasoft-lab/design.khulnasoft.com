## About our Principles

Principles act as a reusable standard for teams to measure their work. They replace subjective ideals with a shared understanding of what the result must do for users. Just as guardrails keep you safe and on the road, principles keep teams on the path to achieving their vision. As it creates alignment it enables us to scale and build velocity.

There are two kinds of principles. Ones that guide the process and ones that define the output. The ones that define processes are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

Each principle has been assigned a hierarchy position in order to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent.

We take inspiration from other companies and look inwards to our own work as to where our principles are best actionable or to be improved to be most effective. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our principles and strive always to make them better. Our principle guidelines are defined at the bottom of this page so everyone is welcome to suggest improvements!

## Productive (1)

Intro stating why, how, and what of the principle.

1. **Bold sub principle(s) title** Explanation, plus optional reference
  - Example(s), plus mandatory reference

## Minimal (2)

Intro stating why, how, and what of the principle.

1. **Bold sub principle(s) title** Explanation, plus optional reference
  - Example(s), plus mandatory reference

## Human (3)

Intro stating why, how, and what of the principle.

1. **Bold sub principle(s) title** Explanation, plus optional reference
  - Example(s), plus mandatory reference

## Principle guidelines

The principles defined should align to the following guidelines to assure they are to be most effective. 

### Origin and purpose

Generally speaking, purpose and values inform principles, while principles inform the product.

Principles should either inform the process or the desired output. The ones that define processes are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

### Explicit hierarchy

Each principle should be assigned a hierarchy position in order to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent.

### Actionable and genuine

Principles should be actionable and thus strike a balance between being too generic and too specific. 

- Genuine (Test: Can you point to the examples that demonstarte this principle?)
- Have a point of view (Test: Could an opposite principle work for another company?)
- Actionable ()
- Memorable (Ideally 3-5, Test: Can your team remeber them?)
- Explicit (They should have their hierarchy defined)

### Format

```
## Principle title (Number of hierarchy position)
