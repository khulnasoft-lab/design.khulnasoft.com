## About our Principles

Principles act as a reusable standard for teams to measure their work. They replace subjective ideals with a shared understanding of what the result must do for users. Just as guardrails keep you safe and on the road, principles keep teams on the path to achieving their vision. As it creates alignment it enables us to scale and build velocity.

There are two kinds of principles. Ones that guide the process and ones that define the output. The ones that define processes are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

Each principle has been assigned a hierarchy position in order to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent.

We take inspiration from other companies and look inwards to our own work as to where our principles are best actionable or to be improved to be most effective. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our principles and strive always to make them better. Our principle guidelines are defined at the bottom of this page so everyone is welcome to suggest improvements!

## Principle guidelines

The principles defined should align to the following guidelines to assure they are to be most effective. 

### Origin and purpose

Generally speaking, purpose and values inform principles, while principles inform the product. Make sure that principles are informed and do not conflict.

Principles should either inform the process or the desired output. The ones that define processes are described in our [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-principles), while the outcome principles are detailed here.

### Target audience

Different teams require different principles in order to guide them, while some principles might be usefull to more than  one. It is important that the target audience is clear in order to avoid confusion while considering when making decisions.

### Actionable and genuine

Principles should be actionable and thus strike a balance between being too generic and too specific. Additionally, for them to be genuine and have context they are required to have real demonstration examples.

### Give direction by being opinionated

When principles have a point of view they give direction and thus keep teams on the path to achieving their vision. It defines a decision where other companies could have diverged. By contrast, it is less effective to state things in principles that are logical and wished upon by default. An example of this would be "Useful", of which the opposite would be "not useful". Slim are the chances a company wants to create such a product and obvious the fact that a company wants to create a useful product.

### Explicit hierarchy

Each principle should be assigned a hierarchy position in order to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent.

### Memorable

Similar to the [GitLab Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#about-our-values), principles are most effective when they are easy to remember. Because of this the amount of principles should be kept low and there is the possibility  to add sub principles. Three to five principles are ideal. Anything that make them even more memorable is helpful.

### Format
