A toggle is a visual switch which acts as a boolean.

## Usage

Use toggles when there is a choice between two selections, it has a default state, the results are effective and noticeable immediately, and there is **no need** for a user to click a submit button.

Avoid using toggles when a submit button is needed. This confuses users and dilutes the experience by preventing instant results.

Toggles may replace a segmented control, two radio buttons, or a single checkbox to allow users to choose between two opposing states. For help with choosing the right solution, follow the table below.

### Labels

Toggle labels are set in bold, positioned above the element by default, and should describe what the control will do when the switch is on in a concise, direct, and short way.

In rare cases and exceptions, the label can be placed to the left of the input field. Examples include non inline positioned elements.

### Visual Design

Toggles should use high-contrast colors to indicate the states - On and Off.
