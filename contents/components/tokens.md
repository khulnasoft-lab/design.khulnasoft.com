Tokens represent keywords input by the user, and are used to search or filter objects. Tokens can be added or removed by the user.

## Usage

A token is used in a search query in places where the user is expected to include multiple queries. For example, tokens are used when adding new users to a project. Multiple users can be added at once, and each inputted user is added as a token within the text field.

[Filters](/components/filters) inherit from tokens, with some additional features.
