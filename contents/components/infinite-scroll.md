Whenever there are too many results to show at once on a page, use infinite scroll to help users parse a large number of items by breaking up lists and distributing the results. Infinite scroll loads the next batch of items in a list below the existing results, once the user has reached the bottom of the page. Infinite scroll removes the need for (paginations](/components/pagination).

## Usage

Use infinite scroll to:

* Present lists with content that updates frequently. For example, Activity and Commits.
* Navigate lists when there is no sort/filter functionality. Lists that only have a search function should use infinite scroll.

We use both infinite scroll and pagination to segment results depending on the user’s task. Compare these guidelines with the [pagination usage guidelines](/components/pagination#usage) if you are unsure of which to use.

### Behavior

Infinite scroll is triggered once the user has reached the 20th item of a list and there are more items to load. A [loading spinner](/components/spinner) appears at the bottom of the list for the duration of the load time.

#### List count

Always display a counter that details how many items have already loaded and how many items remain. This gives the user an indication of where they are relative to the list. The examples below show how to display different variations of list counts:

Todo: add infinite scroll example with "Showing 60 of 100 items" in the list count

Todo: add infinite scroll example with "Showing 60 of 1,000+ items" in the list count

Todo: add infinite scroll example with "Showing 1,200 of 1,000+ items"" in the list count

Todo: add infinite scroll example with "Showing all items" in the list count

#### Returning to a list

When a user returns to a list from a list entry using the back button in the browser, they should be returned to the same place in the list where they left off.
