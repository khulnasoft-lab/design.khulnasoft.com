<todo>Add infinite scroll to Pajamas UI Kit</todo>

## Structure

1. **Container**: Wraps the content.
1. **Item**: Item within the infinite scroll list.
1. **Scrollbar**: Scrollbar that appears when scrolling the list.
1. **Count**: Text displaying number of shown items out of total number of items in the list.

## Guidelines

### When to use

- A list with content that updates frequently. 
- A list when there is no sort/filter functionality. 

### When not to use

- If a list has to load **more than 20 items at a time**, consider using [pagination](/components/pagination).

### Behavior

- Infinite scroll is triggered once the user has reached the 20th item of a list and there are more items to load. 
- A [loading spinner](/components/spinner) appears at the bottom of the list for the duration of the load time.
- When a user returns to a list from a list entry using the back button in the browser, they should be returned to the same place in the list where they left off.

### Content

#### List count

Always display a counter that details how many items have already loaded and how many items remain. This gives the user an indication of where they are relative to the list.
